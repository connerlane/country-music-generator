It sure is pourinâ down tonight
It hasnât stopped since nine
And itâs poundinâ on the roof
Where under it I used to sleep with you
So good but not this time
Weâve gone so far apart since goodbye
And I couldnât feel more alone tonight
And youâre the only thing thatâs on my mind


[Chorus:]
And the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you

Yeah I should be cleaninâ my closet
Fixinâ that drippinâ water faucet
Anything to keep my mind from runninâ back to you
Instead Iâm lookinâ up at the ceilinâ
With that same old missing you feelinâ
Wonderinâ if youâre thinkinâ the same thing too


[Chorus:]
And the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you

Yeah I know we had to end it baby
Weâre pretty good at drivinâ each other crazy
But I will always love you


[Chorus:]
And as the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you
Just ainât no fun without you
