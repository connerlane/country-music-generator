Just like you know your southern stars always gonna come back out
Iâll give you everything I got like nobody else you found
Open up your heart, open up your eyes, baby listen to the sound
Of my voice when I tell you girl donât worry I ainât ever gonna let you down
I wanna show you where Iâm from, take you for a ride on a long dirt road
Let you see, let you taste, let you feel, just a little bit of that moonshine glow
I wonât hold you down, or hold you back, but I wonât let you go
This ainât no one night show

I heard you lookinâ for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you lookinâ for a good man
Well you lookinâ at a good man now

I'll climb your tower, slay your dragons, fight your battles girl

Donât even worry bout it, I like it yeah, I gotcha girl
Câmon wonât cha give it a whirl

I heard you lookinâ for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you lookinâ for a good man
Well you lookinâ at a good man now, ainât cha girlâ¦

I ain't no bad boy, I used to be but I ainât no more
(I ain't no bad boy, I ain't no bad boy)
