Worn and haggard, weathered and torn
Drug through the keyhole of that back door
Blood shot red behind these shades
I look like hell, yes, I've seen better days

And then those loving armsâthey pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

I'm rust on a barbed wire, I'm dust on a chrome yeah
Yes I'm the heart that bleeds in an old country song

And then those loving armsâthey pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

Leather and lace, denim and pearls,
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here loving me

Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work
And she slips her hands right under my shirt

Oh, with those loving arms she pulls me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

There you go, baby, making me look good again
