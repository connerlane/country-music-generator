I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a haircut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up someone George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss

I did it for the girl, dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt and pull me through the front door
I did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl
