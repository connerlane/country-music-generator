I'm a fool falling saying crazy things but I'm hoping and praying that you'll know what I mean yeah,
I wish I had the lines but if you could read between then you know what you mean to me

But when I say heaven I'll be laying by your side and about forever I mean as long as you'll be mine
But when I say perfect I mean every little thing that you do oh and when I say beautiful,
wonderful one too good to be true I mean you, I mean you

When I say better girl I mean me since I found you when I say nothing that's exactly what I wouldn't do to keep you smiling
oh laughing baby you would too oh you and me looking back too

But when I say heaven I'll be laying by your side and about forever I mean as long as you'll be mine
But when I say perfect I mean every little thing that you do oh and when I say beautiful, wonderful one too good to be true I mean you, I mean you

You say hello my angel sing you say good night I can't wait to dream about tomorrow everyday that follows when you say I miss you,
I miss you more but I say lost that was me before I met you but now that I met you
Baby heaven is laying by your side and forever and me as long as you're mine

When I say perfect I mean every little thing that you do oh and when I say beautiful,
wonderful one too good to be true I mean you oh when I say beautiful,
wonderful one too good to be true I mean you, baby I mean you, I mean you
Oh baby you know, you know, you know I'm talking about you
Oh I'm talking about you
I mean you
