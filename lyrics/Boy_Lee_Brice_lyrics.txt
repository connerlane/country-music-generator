Boy, you gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you gonna hate this town
I wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is twenty counties wide
But boy, you gonna love seventeen
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

You gonna drive and kiss and throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You gonna drop the ball, hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will
'Cause you're a part of me
And a part of you
Will always be a...

Boy, you gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

You gonna drive and kiss and throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You gonna drop the ball, hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will
'Cause you're a part of me
And a part of you
Will always be my boy

It's 3 AM and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

But boy, you gonna come back home
You gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Until you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two
