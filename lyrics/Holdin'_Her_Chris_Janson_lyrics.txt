Well I woke up in places I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
It's hard to believe that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time, right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road

And oh when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her

Now on a park bench down on 4th street, that's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped the ring on her hand
Oh, then a few short years later God put into my world
A six pound and an eight ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell ya now, I became a brand new man

Because when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing, yeah that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where, no matter where we are
Well I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her

Yeah I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her
