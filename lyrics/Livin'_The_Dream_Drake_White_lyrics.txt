Everybody say we wouldnât make it baby
Love donât live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reason just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah, just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Put on a little ole Keith Whitley
Back porch dancinâ singinâ with me
Iâm no stranger to the rain, no, no we ainât
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah, just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Oh yeah
Oh baby, ainât we livinâ the dream

Look at us we got a life down here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last yearâs deer
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hanginâ
Kids in the back just a tire swinginâ
Fireworks a booming and banging
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doinâ half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Oh, oh
Yeah

They say weâd never make it baby
Love donât live around here much lately
What do you think about that?
