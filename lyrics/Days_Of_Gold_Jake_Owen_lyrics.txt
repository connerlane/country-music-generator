Long truck bed, hop in it, fire engine red like her lipstick
Out here we can let it go, yeah
Just me and my good friends, jug of wine a little sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little July sky, so high moon shine by the riverside
Stealin' hearts and runnin' wild
Yeah, our own world, Tennessee boys and girls runnin' free
Out here it's good times for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you wanna do, what's it gonna be
We can get wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice of watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back stickin' to the seat
We can sneak off and beat the heat
I'll be buzzin' on you honey like a bumblebee

Yeah, it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shining down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold
