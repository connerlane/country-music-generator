I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ainât slowinâ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh sheâs giving you now

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, âcause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, âcause maybe then youâd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

I donât get no sleep, I donât get no peace
Thinkinâ about her under your bed sheets
The way that sheâs whisperinâ, the way that sheâs pullinâ you in
Lord knows Iâve tried, I canât get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, âcause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, âcause maybe then youâd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ainât slowinâ down
