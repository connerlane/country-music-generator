Hey baby won't you tell me what you've got going on
Just a little later on tonight
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on, later on, later on

Girl you're shining like a movie star
And y'know you look so good
I can't stop starin'
And I can tell that you're feelin' it too
What you wanna do with that smile you're wearin'
Oh yea

What you say we got lost lets go
Spend a couple hours just gettin'
To know each other out there in the moonlight glow
And when we get alone

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on
Yea

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on, later on, later on

That come on feeling getting strong
Drink it up 'till it's gone
This is what we're waiting on
Later on, later on, yeah!
