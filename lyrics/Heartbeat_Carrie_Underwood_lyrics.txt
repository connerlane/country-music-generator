I love it when we're at a party
In a down-town crowd
But I can't hear you call me, baby,
With the music up loud

Red wine,
Good times,
No, I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I--
I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background,
Underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

Oh, whoa,
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

And I wanna feel it like a kick drum,
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me
And make me hold my breath

You pull me closer,
My head on your shoulder,
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen-star wish,
One more slow kiss,
What are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background,
Underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
