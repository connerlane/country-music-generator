There's one sittin' in a pawn shop, glass counter, someone down in California traded it for a TV
Another one in a pretty blue box somewhere up in New York, white ribbon, Tiffany's
One's catchin' dust in a drawer in a dresser at your grandma's house that's been there since 1953
But honestly

A diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds

I ain't saying they aren't pretty and the way they feel doesn't feel just like an answer to a little girls dream
Ain't saying they ain't fun to show off to your friends and get the chills when you hear them scream
But if your hearts not in it, forget it

Cause a diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds

I don't need one just to hold on to
I don't want one unless it comes with you

Cause a diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds
