Wrecking balls, downtown construction
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing
Cardboard sign says "The Lord is Coming"
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothing left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop this noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

All this noise
Can't take the noise
Can't take the noise
Can't stand the noise
Can't take the noise
