Black pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down right now

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going
Quite like you do when you doin' the things that you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about

We went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancin'
Didn't take long, just a couple of songs
You know it's last call when the law comes walkin' in

So we went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off In a spot nobody else knows

We went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end

Black pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little of dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down right now
