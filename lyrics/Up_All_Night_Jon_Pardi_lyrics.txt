Yeah girl, I just had me,
One hell of a work week.
It's been driving me crazy,
Not enough of you baby.
And I been a-thinkin',
'Bout breakin' in the weekend
Not doin' any sleepin'
So get in, let's take a ride

And baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No tellin' when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
I couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

So baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Come Monday, I'll be back to workin' and savin'
But until then, yeah

Baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Yeah, me and you
Up all night, yeah
