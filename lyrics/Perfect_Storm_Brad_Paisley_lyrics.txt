If she was a drink, she'd be single barrel bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick, a chill and a burn all at the same time
She's Sunday drive meets high-speed chase
She ain't just a song, she's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated that's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus:]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

I know how to make her laugh or blush or mad at me
But that's OK, there ain't no one more beautiful angry
And she loves just as deep as she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows, can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus:]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

She's the thrill of a lifetime a guy like me spends his whole life looking for
That girl right there's the perfect storm

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

(She destroys me in that t-shirt)
