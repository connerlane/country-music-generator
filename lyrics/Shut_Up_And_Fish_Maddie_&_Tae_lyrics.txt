He pulled up in his red Corvette
Salmon shorts and a white V-neck
I said, "Wow, you know how to dress down for a city guy."

We headed out to a spot on the lake
A couple Zebcos and a cup full of bait
I could tell pretty fast he had more than just bass on his mind

Oh, I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and trying to hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

For a little while he calmed down and let up
But then he went right back to pushing his luck
That line of mine wasn't all I wanted to throw in
Oh, no

I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and trying to hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

I finally had all of him that I could take
So I gave him a cold shower in the lake

What can I say?

I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Playing captain Casanova

[Alternative version:]
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and tryna hold my reeling hand

[Alternative version:]
Trying to reach out and hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

Just a little push
'Cause he couldn't just
Shut up and fish
