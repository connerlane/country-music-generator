Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Yeah, you act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burning the midnight down again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Every goodbye is bittersweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me
