I'm a dirt road
In the headlights
I'm a mama's boy
I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line
Kinda cold beer
Little hat down
Little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see the girl standin' right there

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance
To some old school
She'll take a full moon
Over them city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah I can smooth it out
I can slick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough

Of a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me
Yeah

Yeah
I'm her sure thing
I'm her go-to
I'm her rock solid
She ain't gon' ever lose

A small town boy like me
I'm her ride or die baby
I'm her cool, I'm her crazy
I'm her laid back in the front seat
I'm so with ya to the end girl
Let's turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me
Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me
