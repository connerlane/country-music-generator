Ain't no corn in that field
Big crack in the windshield
From that January cold snap
Baby don't look back
I got the wheel, yeah

Three hundred twenty nine
Miles to the shoreline
Sunset on a billboard
Girl that's what we're in for
Yeah, that's a good sign

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather
Yeah

No, it won't be long now
We'll be rollin' these windows down
You'll be pullin' that sweater off
Puttin' on a summer song and
Crankin' it up loud, yeah

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather

Gotta get you outta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun
Wanna see you lyin' there
Your bikini top girl and I'm done
Can't wait to get there

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather

(Gotta get you outta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun)
Oh wayfarer weather
Underneath that big blue sky, yeah
(Wanna see you lyin' there
Your bikini top girl and I'm done)
