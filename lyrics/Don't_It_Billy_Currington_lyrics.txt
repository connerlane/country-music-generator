Baby, don't say "No" so quick.
This ain't about me tryin' to see
How far that I can get,
But I ain't gonna lie,
I wouldn't mind
Just a little bit of you and I:
Eye to eye,
Lips on lips, swayin' to the music
Real close.
We could both use
A little let-go
Kinda night,
Baby, if you want a good time.

We can get on it.
Let's take a shot or you can sip on it.
We'll find a floor we can dance on it, slow-song it.
'Far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it.
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights.

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it.
Sounds pretty good, don't it?

Well, I've just now seen that smile
And I bet it's been a minute since you tapped on
Into your wild and crazy side.
So, baby, let's do this tonight.
Baby, that moon looks just right.
Don't fight it.
If you want a good time

We can get on it.
Take a shot or you can sip on it.
We'll find a floor we can dance on it, slow-song it.
'Far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it.
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights.

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it.
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?

So, baby, let's get on it.
You're gonna love it, you can bet on it.
Karaoke: we can microphone it.
Whatever you want it.

As far as I can see that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?

Yeah, don't it?
Get your feeling all right, girl.
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?
Now, don't it, baby?
