If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows Iâd sip it nice and slow
Iâd try to pick a place that ainât too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go

You can bet Iâd order up a couple tall ones
Tell the waitress put âem on my tab
Iâd be sure to let him do the talkinâ
Careful when I got the chance to ask

Howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Do you hear the prayers I send
What happens when life ends
And when you think youâre cominâ back again
Iâd tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

If I could have a beer with Jesus
Iâd put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
Fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
Sit somewhere we couldnât see a clock

Ask him howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Have you been there from the start
Howâd you change a sinnerâs heart
And is heaven really just beyond the stars
Iâd tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

He can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray heâs stayinâ till we shut the whole place down

Ask him howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Whatâs on the other side?
Is mom and daddy alright?
And if it ainât no trouble tell them I said hi
Iâd tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Iâd tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
