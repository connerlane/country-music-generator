Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But youâre the kinda girl thatâs got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ainât nothing
They ainât never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ainât nothing hotter


[Chorus:]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
Iâll take a sip of that smile
Iâll bet the boys at home canât leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
Youâre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youâre just so homegrown

Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying âSon itâs onâ
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song


[Repeat Chorus]

Ooh baby, baby, baby
Youâre driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Iâm a long way away from where Iâm from
But baby you feel like home


[Repeat Chorus]

Youâre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youâre just so homegrown
