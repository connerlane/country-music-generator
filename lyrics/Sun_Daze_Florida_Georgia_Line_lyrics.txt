Alright
Make you wanna dance don't it baby

I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on a cornhole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's goin, that keg gonna be floatin'

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I'll sit you up on the kitchen sink
And stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin we gone by this evenin

But all I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

Take em out to the sticks, boys c'mon

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
