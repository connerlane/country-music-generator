Roll in the bar, me and my crewâ¨
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookinâ me up, yeahâ¨
Buyinâ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing


[Chorus:]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anythingâ¨
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreamsâ¨
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see youâ¨
Jumpinâ up there with the bandâ¨
Takinâ me by the handâ¨
Hey boy, come dance with meâ¨
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truckâ¨
By the light of the midnight moonâ¨
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it goodâ¨
You don't know how bad that I wish I couldâ¨
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong


[Repeat Chorus]

Your lips, your eyesâ¨
Girl, since you told me goodbye


[Repeat Chorus]

Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you
