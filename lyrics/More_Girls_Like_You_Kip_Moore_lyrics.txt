Well, I've been living like a wild old mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might've earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So unreigned, so untamed, yeah

So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

Your soul is pure golden
Must've been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you...

It's been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn't make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made

Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah

Yeah

More girls like...
Yeah

More girls like you
Yeah
