I had a couple beers with one of my friends
âTold him just how our story ends
âDid all I could to try to make it work
âBut you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt
â
âI've been out the house, climbin' them walls
âCheckin' that calendar, exin' days off
âHit another bar, call another friend
âThrow a few down, tell the story again
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
âI can just lie and say it's all okay
âOh-ho, what can I do?
âBeen goin' through Hell gettin' over you
âBut it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
âNo it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
â
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
âLife is good, I met me a girl
âShe got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
âI don't hardly ever think about you
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

âSometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
âSometimes I break down and cry
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you

âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
âNo it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
