I got the truck warmed up, all gassed up
Rolling down the road at 3
Got on a sock cap, a saw in the back
Yeah, we're fixing to cut down a tree
Hey, timberrr!
You can smell the pine, every single mile
Get it on back to the house!
Shake off the snow, make it all glow,
Momma break the eggnog out!

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x2]

Front yard's blinking, whole town's singing
Rudolf and Jingle Bell Rock
Nana wants a snuggie
Papi wants some money
I just wanna drink a lot
Deceeeeember!
Got cookies in the oven
Everybody's coming
Party starts Christmas Eve!
Better hit the hay, Santa's on his way
Cause uncle cousin Johnny still believes!

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x2]

Hey
Timberrrr
Decemberrr

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x4]
