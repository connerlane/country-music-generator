Yeah, you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around, spillin' their beer
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say we leave your friends with mine?
Oooh, oooh, yeah, they'll be alright
Oooh, I just wanna see you shine

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

Yeah, let me see you, girl

Whatcha think about takin' that chance?
Takin' a ride, takin' my hand?
Kickin' this crowd, ditchin' this club?
This night's been waitin' on us

Oooh, oooh, save your best moves
Oooh, yeah, til I get us where we're gettin' to

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

I could see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
Movin' your hips like wind moves cotton
You could get the whole wide country side hoppin'

Oooh, oooh, bring the beat back
Oooh, oooh, aww, come on with me, girl

Yeah, you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

Yeah, let me see you, girl

Come on, come on, come on, let me see you, girl
