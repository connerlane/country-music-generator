We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach â Iâd rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, thatâs not true

But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

Weâll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
Weâll play Jack Johnson, heâs the new Don Ho
And weâll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio

'Cause you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
You know it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Oh, hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love

You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy

You make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and sip tequila all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Tell me now, who needs Mexico?
Baby let's stay home
Baby let's stay home

Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...

Go on a little holiday...
