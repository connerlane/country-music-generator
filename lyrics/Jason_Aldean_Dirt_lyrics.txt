Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too

Better watch out for the boys in blue
And, all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread?
Like I know somethin' y'all don't know,
Man that talk is gettin' old
You better mind your business man,
Watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them ol' dirt roads, is what y'all missin'

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really want to know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the black top ends

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights

It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
