Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
