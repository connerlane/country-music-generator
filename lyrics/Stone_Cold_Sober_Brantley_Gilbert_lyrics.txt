I guess I said some thing's last night
That usually in the morning light
I regret
Like double shots and cigarettes
Said things like
"I love you baby" and
"I know I sound crazy but let's just work this out ya and maybe settle down"

I woke up hungover
But still had to call you
Cause I just realized girl
That maybe it was all true
Yeah

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
That it didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah I can lie about 99 percent of the time
When I've had too much to drink
Yeah I do stupid things

But this time is different
And baby it feels so right
I hope you were listening
To every word I said last night

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
That it didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah I got blood shot eyes
(Got blood shot eyes)
But it's all crystal clear
(All crystal clear)
Well I know I don't need Jim Beam
To know I need you here

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
And I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
Baby all I know is I still need you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah baby I'm stone cold sober

Come on over
