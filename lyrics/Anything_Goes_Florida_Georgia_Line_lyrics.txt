Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Let's go
... to mess around
Feels good, darling

Big stars breaking out through the indigo
Chevy wind coming in, in stereo
Tail lights disappearin' bout a mile or so
Down the county road
Phone blowing up "where you is?"
Baby sayin' "baby, let's do this"
Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
Bout to lift it off, I'm bout to twist it off

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Well baby you ain't nothin' but a masterpiece
Swaying and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big loud beat
Nothin' but heat, come on

Somebody's rockin' that bang box
Everybody's hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tick tock
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night

Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Let's go

Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Come on

Come on
Let's go

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night

Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Come on baby
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
