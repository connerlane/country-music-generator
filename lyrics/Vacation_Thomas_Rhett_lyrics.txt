My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like sheâs sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks but Iâm spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting cause itâs always getting hotter

Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like itâs Jamaica and Iâm sipping on some Red Stripe
But Iâm in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
(I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started melting so Iâll take another swallow

Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Iâm gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know

Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

Sing it to me
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation
(Yeah dude, just party every time)
