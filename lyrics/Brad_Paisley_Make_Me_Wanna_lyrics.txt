[Brad:]
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again


[Brad:]
Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck

[Carrie:]
Remind me, remind me

[Brad:]
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough

[Carrie:]
Remind me, remind me


[Carrie:]
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop

[Brad:]
I felt bad cause you missed your flight

[Carrie and Brad:]
But that meant we had one more night


[Carrie:]
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep

[Brad:]
Remind me, baby, remind me

[Carrie:]
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much

[Brad:]
Remind me, baby, remind me


[Brad:]
I wanna feel that way

[Carrie:]
Yeah, I wanna hold you close

[Brad and Carrie]
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know


[Carrie:]
Baby, remind me, remind me


[Carrie:]
Do you remember the way it felt?

[Brad:]
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves

[Carrie:]
Remind me

[Brad:]
Yeah, remind me

[Carrie:]
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me


[Brad:]
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me


[Brad and Carrie]
Oh, baby, remind me


[Carrie:]
Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me

[Brad:]
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt

[Carrie:]
Remind me, yeah, oh

[Brad:]
Baby, remind me
