Well hey, this is you and me against the world
Two crazy kids, a boy and a girl
You're a spark, a match, I'm gasoline
You light me up honey, what I mean is

You put the beat in my heart
You put the smile on my face
You put the color in my sky
Otherwise a cloudy day
You put the swing in my dance
You put the speed in my run
Close your eyes, baby
Kiss the midnight sun
I'm a fire because of you
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue

We're all gonna fall, that's part of the plan
Hold on to each other when we got no place to stand
When it feels like we're a million miles apart
I'll be shouting for you in the dark cause

You put the beat in my heart
You put the smile on my face
You put the color in my sky
Otherwise a cloudy day
You put the swing in my dance
You put the speed in my run
Close your eyes, baby
Kiss the midnight sun
I'm a fire because of you
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue

[x2]

Yeah, I'm a fire because of you
Yeah, I'm a fire, burning blue
Yeah, I'm a fire
Yeah, I'm a fire
Baby, I'm a fire
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue
