Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?
I swear I felt it slowing down for a minute
I know it sounds crazy, but looking at you, baby
With your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion
Your body's swaying like a waves in the ocean
I know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking

If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time

Ain't gotta worry about a beach bar closing
I got a bottle of tequila we can open right here
I'm just saying, it's like we're on vacation

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time, yeah

If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time
