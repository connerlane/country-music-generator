You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes

Tonight let's raise 'em up
To where we ended up

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here.
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

I didn't have much money but I covered them rounds
'Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fellow throw his money down
You weren't shooting whiskey just shootin' the shhh...
I paid the tab, we walked out the door and I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here,
Oh, it all started with a beer. Yeah.
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

Here's to you, baby. Oh-oh-oh.

So tonight let's raise 'em up
To where we ended up

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here,
Oh, it all started with a beer. Oh.
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer. Oh. Yeah.
Oh

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer.
Oh.
