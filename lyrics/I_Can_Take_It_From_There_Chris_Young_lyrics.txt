Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight.
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer, so baby tell me would it be alright if we just take a little rain check and stay right here.
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do, as a matter of fact baby why don't you grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine.
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights, and baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair and I can take if from there.
Yeah I can take it from there.

I'm gonna put an ol' record on, Conway Twitty.
Yeah girl I'd love to lay you down.
Kill the ringer on the telephone, ain't gonna stop lovin' you til the candle burns out.
Oh there it is, that little smile of yours.
Come on, baby, what you waitin' for.
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine, walk down the hall and turn down the lights, and baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair.
And I can take it from there.

Tomorrow's gonna be here way too soon.
Let's not waste another minute girl, I got plans for me and you.
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine, walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights.
Baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair.
And I can take it from there.
Oh I can take it from there.
