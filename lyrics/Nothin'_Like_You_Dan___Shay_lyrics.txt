Mmm
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
Whole party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you

When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothin' like you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah

Never seen, never seen nothin' like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Mmm
Never seen nothin' like you
