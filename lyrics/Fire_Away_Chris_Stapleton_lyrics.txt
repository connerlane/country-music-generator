Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend Iâm a shelter for heartaches that donât have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that Iâll say is


[Chorus:]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Iâm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That Iâve never been here before
But you know and I know
That Iâll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But Iâll cry to my grave


[Chorus x2]
