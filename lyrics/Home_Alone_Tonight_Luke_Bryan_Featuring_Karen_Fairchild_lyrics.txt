(Oh, oh)

What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl. What you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink

So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling' off the top

And we'll go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band,
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab.
Girl, we got all night, I've got a bottomless tab
So let's goâ¦

Shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

It feels too good to let it end right here (I ain't going home alone home tonight)
So let's not let it end, let it end right here (girl, you're going home with me tonight)

So let's go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Well, I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight
Baby, don't let me go home alone
Home alone tonight
