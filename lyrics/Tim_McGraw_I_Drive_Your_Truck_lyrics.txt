Eighty-Nine Cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hanginâ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy, but thatâs alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and Iâve got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And youâd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollinâ down on my face
Hey, man Iâm tryinâ to be tough
And momma asked me this morning
If Iâd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ainât where I feel you anyway

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

Iâve cussed, Iâve prayed, Iâve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when Iâm missing you this much

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes, brother sometimes

I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you donât mind, I hope you donât mind
I drive your truck
