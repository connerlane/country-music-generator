I don't know where this is going but I know what I've been thinking
Since the sun started sinking down
I wanna take you where the vines grow up in the trees
We can roll up our jeans and figure this out

Oh oh oh,
Bring your bare feet
Oh oh oh,
Come with me

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

The stars are hanging low enough
For us to touch and show enough
We're gonna get closer tonight
We've been feeling what we're feeling without saying what we're meaning
No more beating round the bushes, alright?
Alright

Oh oh oh,
Are you ready?
Oh oh oh,
Come with me

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

Just testing the water
