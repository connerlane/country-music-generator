I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back

I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
(I love this life, I love this life, I love this life)

I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and I thank the Lord for this life of mine


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
