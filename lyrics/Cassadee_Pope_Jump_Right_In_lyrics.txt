I know I just met you
Been talking your ears off
But I wanna know everything
And I got all night long

Are you tryna be someone for someone?
'Cause you remind me of where I come from
So boy, I know it's kinda soon
But I'll tell you what I wanna do

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy, I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Daddy's gonna love you
He'll probably talk your ears off
Drive you by the little church
That saved me when I got lost
Take you down roads that I grew up on
Wish on those stars I used to wish on
Kiss you on the bleachers on the 50 yard line
Boy, you know, I...

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Oh, I ain't tryna jump the gun
Sure ain't tryna make you run
But the second I saw you
I knew I had to get you alone

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

And tell you 'bout me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
