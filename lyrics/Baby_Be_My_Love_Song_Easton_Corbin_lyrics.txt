So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playinâ, everyone went home
But the stars are still out and youâre so damn hot
And I ainât ready for the music to stop


[Chorus:]
Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockinâ âtil the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, âOh hell yeah!â
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along cominâ on
Baby be my love song

Girl, fast or slow, three-quarter time
It donât have to make sense
And it donât have to rhyme
As long as itâs you
Babe, Iâm all in
And when itâs over
Just play it again


[Repeat Chorus]

Baby be my melody
My little feel good that gets to me
Donât be shy baby, set it free
Crank it up, hit me way down deep


[Repeat Chorus]

I feel a little sing-along, sing-along cominâ on
Baby be my love song
Baby be my love song, oh yeah
Be my love song
