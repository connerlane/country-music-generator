There's a cabin in a valley,
My grandpa built on your land.
Your mountains are a canvas,
For the makers hand.

Tonight I'm fishing Elk River,
If only in my mind.
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time.

I carry you in my heart
your memory comes over me like the dark and


[Refrain]
Like a phone call from my baby,
Sayin' honey I miss ya like crazy.
Like the sound of a siren song,
Oh Carolina, ya keep callin me home.
Callin' me home.

Sometimes I grow weary,
From goin' all the time.
I love to take a minute,
Let you ease my mind.

I'd love to see my mama
Maybe go for a drive
But I gotta play the star in some little town again tonight

Don't get me wrong
I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you


[Refrain]

Callin' me home
Callin' me home
Callin' me home, yeah

Oh, oh, we're almost home

Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin honey I miss ya, I miss ya like crazy
Just like the song of a siren song

Oh Carolina,
Carolina,
Carolina,
Keep callin me home,
Callin' me home,
Callin' me home,
Callin' me home

Carolina,
Carolina,
Keep callin' me home.
