The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had "The Guns" on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, "Sweet Child O' Mine"
Sipping on the locos spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?

Out of nowhere it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that we knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the colour from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grid and the game

But I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
We had "The Guns" on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, "Sweet Child O' Mine"
Sipping on the locos spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses drying out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads, your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now?
Time, time, time
