I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah

So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

Yeah, Iâm here to pick you up
And I hope I donât let you down, no, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
