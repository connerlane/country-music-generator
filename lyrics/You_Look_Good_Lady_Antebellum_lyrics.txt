[Charles Kelley:]
On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand
In the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts
Breaking necks
When we rolling down the street
Heads turning all day
When they see you with me


[Hillary Scott:]
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it
And, baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good


[Charles Kelley:]
Black dress to the 9s
New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof
Make the skyline spin

[Hillary Scott:]
Yeah, you're killing me, boy, in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it
Baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good


[Hillary Scott:]
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good

Baby, you look good
Aw, come on, baby, you look good
(You look good)
Baby, you look good
