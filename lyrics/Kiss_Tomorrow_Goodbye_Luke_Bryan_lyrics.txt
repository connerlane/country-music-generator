All we do right is make love and
We both know now that ainât enough
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didnât work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Kiss tomorrow goodbye.
