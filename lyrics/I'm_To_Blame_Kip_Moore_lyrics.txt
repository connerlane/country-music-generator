If it ainât broke, you can bet that Iâm gonna break it
If thereâs a wrong road, Iâm damn sure gonna take it
Where thereâs smoke, my pocket lighter sparked the fire
Where thereâs blue lights, just read me my rights

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

Where thereâs a love, I tell ya, girl, I love to hate it
Where thereâs a do not touch, my finger print done stained it
Where thereâs a train wreck, sit on back and watch me crash
Where thereâs a what, you say, damn right I said it

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

For breaking your heart, taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud, where thereâs a scar I carved it out

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame
