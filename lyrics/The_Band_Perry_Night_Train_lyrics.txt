You can find my face where the moon light lingers
Cause it's Friday night and it's as hot as ever
My heart is banging to the beat of the band
Me and my pals we got scars from the week
But now we're all getting loud and we're moving our feet
As we do our best to let things get out of hand

It's a night gone wasted again
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted
Oh yeah

All of our eyes they've got rings of fire
Cause we're burning time like there's no tomorrow
It's gonna take a while to blow off a week's worth of steam
Tell your sweet mama not to worry her pretty little head
I'll have you home soon and then I'll tuck you in bed
But until then let's do our best to get out of hand

Man oh man

It's a night gone wasted again
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted
Oh yeah

Oh what a riot it's been
I'm gonna save up some more money to spend on another night

Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted tonight
Alright
We're going out tonight
Again

Oh yeah
