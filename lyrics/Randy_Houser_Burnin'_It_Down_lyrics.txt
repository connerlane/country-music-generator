Get your pretty little self shined up
Girl were gettin' outta here, yeah we're getting' out there tonight
We can take it through town 'til the roads run out
Where the world slows down, watch the moon get drunk on you
Smile

Can't get there quick enough
Can't wait to drink it up
Gonna find your favorite song
And watch it turn you on

So I can see your sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight

(No way I'm gonna get you home)
(No way I'm gonna get you home)

Ruby red deep Eddy in your cup
Just a sip of that stuff makes your lips so sweet when ya kiss me
Kiss me baby
Get your bare feet in the cool grass
Get to movin' that oh yeah oh yeah ya know just how to kill me
Killin' me baby
The sun is burnin' out
Let's pull it over now
Can't wait to watch ya let your hair down, hair down

So I can see that sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights, hmm
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight

I can see your sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight
Before midnight

Get you home before midnight
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
Before midnight
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
Before midnight
