Roll, won't you come roll with me slow, fast, full speed
Girl wherever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh

Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream, don't wanna be
Cruisin' through this dream without you


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, Oh Oh


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh

No other shotgun rider, Oh Oh

Singin' to the radio, Oh Oh

You're my shotgun rider.
