[CHORUS]
Things are tough all over
And I'm losin' badly
I wish you were still here
And I said it sadly
But if you wanna come back
Cause you need a shoulder
Things are tough all over

Guess I should count my blessings
For the life i still have
In a world of misfortune
That can happen so fast
Life size dominoes
One falls after another
Things are tough all over

Baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well, I hope you're not turnin'
On the other side of town
Cause things are tough all over

Well, baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well I hope you're not hurtin'
On the other side of town


[REPEAT CHORUS]

Things are tough all over
Things are though
Tough
Things are tough
Yeah, things are tough
