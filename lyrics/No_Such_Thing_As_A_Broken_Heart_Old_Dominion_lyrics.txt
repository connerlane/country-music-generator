I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the Heartland just swallow em up?

How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other, that was enough

You know you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat your life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

What am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up

Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's what's up

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat you life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat you life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love love love love... like there's no such thing
You gotta love love love love... as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
