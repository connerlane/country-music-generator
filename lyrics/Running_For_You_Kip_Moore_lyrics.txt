We had a good run
But I knew, I knew, I knew
I knew this day would come
As bad as I want to
Ain't no way, not me, girl
I ain't gonna stop you


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you, yeah

I'm gonna miss you
Baby, there's no way that I can go with you
So, go on and chase it
I know, I know, I know
You can almost taste it
Yeah, time's a wastin'


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you, yeah

It's gonna be a long night
And I might shed a tear
But I'm gonna be alright

And even though you won't be in my arms
You'll be right where you belong
So, go, girl, go, girl, go on


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you
