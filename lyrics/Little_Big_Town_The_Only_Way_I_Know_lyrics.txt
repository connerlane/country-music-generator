Walk with me in a moonlight babe
Lose ourselves in a star parade
And i will sing a midnight serenade for you
Dance with me in a field of green
Be so close i can hear you breathe
Be the end and the in between


[Chorus]
Cause to know you is to know love
And to know love is to know enough
To walk with you through this life
From now until the day i die
What better way is there to live
Than to live with you

So put your song in my silver sky
Put your rain in my river dry
Put your words to my lullaby
And I'll dream of you


[Chorus]


[Chorus]
