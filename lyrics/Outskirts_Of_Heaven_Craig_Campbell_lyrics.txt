My grandpa taught me about buck knives and shotguns
How to cast an old Zebco, how to work a stick shift
He taught me the Bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this

With pearly gates
Streets of gold
He said if I just believe
That's where I'll go

But Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honeybees and blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

Now it says in the King James in the almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'll gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded, and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings

When I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honeybees and blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven... yeah

Yeah, the good Lord knows me, he knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
