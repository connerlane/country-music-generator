Girl I really did mean it when I wished you the best
Good to hear you're killing it way out west
Finding your own way didn't take too long
Baby rock on, rock on

It's getting tough keeping up with where you are
Posting pics like some big Hollywood star
Guess every club in town is playing your song
Baby rock on, rock on

Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Yeah, I do a lotta thinking about wanting you back
But I don't know about all dolled up like that
If my homegrown country girl's long gone
Then baby rock on, rock on

Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Yeah, rock on

I saw your hashtag, digging on some new dude
Girl, you left me with nothing else to do

Rock on like I don't miss you
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til I forget you, just like I wish I would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Baby rock on
Yeah, I should've put a rock on
Yeah, baby rock on
Yeah, I really did mean it when I wished you the best
I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Seems like your memory, has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
It's driving me crazy

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh oh oh

Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, you still got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mmm, outta my head

No you ain't gone,
No you ain't gone,
Yeah outta my head
Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling supper's hot, y'all come and get it
We yelled five more minutes.

At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interrupting that goodnight kissing,
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
Just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket
Can't you give me five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
All the family gathered 'round knew the time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes

Five more minutes
She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
Like smoke, ooh, ooh
Like smoke ooh, ooh

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
She's smoke, ooh, ooh
She's smoke, ooh, ooh
Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him

I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look,
just tell him, it's you, it ain't him,
and maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you're so done with him, break up with him, break up with him

You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend,
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him
Yeah girl, I just had me,
One hell of a work week.
It's been driving me crazy,
Not enough of you baby.
And I been a-thinkin',
'Bout breakin' in the weekend
Not doin' any sleepin'
So get in, let's take a ride

And baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No tellin' when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
I couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

So baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Come Monday, I'll be back to workin' and savin'
But until then, yeah

Baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio,
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
There won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Yeah, me and you
Up all night, yeah
What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
Cause everybody has already tried

Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?

What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em

So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?

So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no

Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway? (Oooooh)
Could you love me anyway?
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

Now baby don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
Plain and simple, girl them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

Now baby don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna

You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Well me and the boys are feelin' alright
Raisin' some hell, sippin' on whiskey and 'shine, yeah
Bob Dylan on the juke box, shooting' some pool
Telling' some stories and stretching the truth and lies
Yeah, I feel the cell phone start buzzing in my pocket

Boys, you keep on rocking' but I gotta roll, roll,
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl

Ain't nothin' you can say, so don't even try
The second she call that little girl made up my mind,
Yeah, she did
Don't' buy me no shot, don't bring me no drink
Don't go wasting' your money on me, bye, bye

Boys, you keep on rocking' but I gotta roll, roll,
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl

If you ever find a girl like mine,
Boys you'll know why

I gotta roll, roll
Point my Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl
Sorry Boys, I gotta go see about my girl

Ooh ooh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh
She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing
Around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Her teenage boyfriends all still dream
About her

She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like
A Tilt-A-Whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no make-up,
Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane
In blue jean pearls

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world

She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was "Hey"
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world
I met a girl
I met a girl
I need a saving grace
A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste
So don't let me be lonely

I wanna shake this winter coat off my sleeve
Dust off a record and just be free
Oh don't let me be lonely
No don't let me be lonely

When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
And we grow up
And then it's gone
Oh God only knows what we'll become

So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely

Well the night rolls on like a long lost friend
'Til the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't let me be lonely

Well there's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me all that you are
You've got nothing to lose
Just don't let me be lonely
No don't let me be lonely

So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely

No
Don't let me be

When you're young
Life's a dream
It's a beautiful and a burning thing
And we grow up
And then it's gone
But the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely
Don't let me be lonely
Don't, don't let me be lonely

No
Don't let me be
Ooh, lonely
I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be
Sitting at home all alone like me

Nothing on TV, nothing to do
Nothing to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinking 'bout it now because...

...I could be there in five?
One more, one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those "kiss-me" eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be,
Baby, I want you, and you want me

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

I can be there in five
One more, one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Oh, I need you and I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight... tonight... tonight
Yeah... yeah.
I get this feeling that I can't explain
Every time I see your face or hear your name
I just go crazy, thinking, baby, this may be my chance
What would you say to me if I said "Baby, let's lay down and dance"

I got to tell you, girl, you drive me wild
Every time I see you dance I see that smile
My world gets hazy and I'm moving like I'm in a trance
Whoa, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance

When it comes to love my heart is black and it's blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you're something and I'm counting on you
You're my brand new second chance

My friends all tell me that I'm not your kind
They say I better pray your love is blind
You got to save me, I'm a victim of your circumstance
Whoa, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance

When it comes to love my heart is black and it's blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you're something and I'm counting on you
You're my brand new second chance

I got to tell you, girl, you drive me wild
I've never known no one with quite your style
I'm going crazy, thinking, baby, this may be my chance
What would you say to me if I said "Baby, let's lay down and dance"
Girl, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance

[Charles Kelley:]
On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand
In the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts
Breaking necks
When we rolling down the street
Heads turning all day
When they see you with me


[Hillary Scott:]
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it
And, baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good


[Charles Kelley:]
Black dress to the 9s
New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof
Make the skyline spin

[Hillary Scott:]
Yeah, you're killing me, boy, in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it
Baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good


[Hillary Scott:]
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
From the second that you walk in it
And, baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, come on, baby, you look good
(You look good)
Baby, you look good
There's a trail of smoke comin' out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt from a few too many beers

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw 'em up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been and we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world

In that old sea shell you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash whisper in your ear
A little glow in the night, its the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing called 'make me disappear'

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw 'em up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been, we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world

There ain't no empty glasses, they're playing drift away
That's where the magic happens, back up in that little bay

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been, we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world
If I could be the reason your hair's a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass
The swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket
And the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain
The spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

And oh,
All of this talkin makes you laugh
But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm
Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Yea
Falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
Be what you mean to me
Ohhhhh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean, what you mean to me
I'm gonna take you for a date
Take you for a ride
Gonna get you over there on the passenger side
I'm gonna put the radio on your favorite song
I'm gonna crank it on up and get you singing along

Hey, hey (Hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm diggin' on hittin' on you tonight
It ain't a maybe, it's hopin'
I'm wishin' I wanna
It's a damn right
Hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

So what's it gonna take?
What's it gonna be?
We can pump it on the boulevard
Or kick it in the country
Me and you, you and me,
Money back, guaranteed
Love you every night in Daytona, I'm gonna

Hey, hey (Hey, hey)
Alright (alright)
Girl I'm diggin' on hittin' on you tonight

Gonna be your man
Gonna put a little rock steady on your hand

Alright (alright)

It's a damn right
Hold you tight, baby I'm gonna

Hey hey (Hey hey)
Alright (alright)

Hey hey (Hey hey)
Alright (alright)
When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

C'mon now
Aww that's right
Oh you look so fine

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words

Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ainât slowinâ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh sheâs giving you now

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, âcause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, âcause maybe then youâd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

I donât get no sleep, I donât get no peace
Thinkinâ about her under your bed sheets
The way that sheâs whisperinâ, the way that sheâs pullinâ you in
Lord knows Iâve tried, I canât get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, âcause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, âcause maybe then youâd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ainât slowinâ down
We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah, we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

And that's why we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

We were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

Yeah, we were legends
And we wrote our own story
Raise em' up
I'm talkin' 'bout lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like
And you sing along

Raise em' up
I'm talkin' 'bout daddy's old pick-up truck
Shotgun seat there's the one you love
And you're kissin' on

Get those white sails sailin' down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass
If you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes
Up to the sky
Comin' home you've been gone too long
Tonight we're gonna
Raise em' up

Raise em' up
You've got a voice, you've got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let em' tell you
Who you are

Raise em' up
Fist black and blue
Fight for the truth
It's what you do
Hand on your heart
For the stripes and stars

Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
Sunday morning coming down
Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
And as the flag flies say goodbye
Tonight we're gonna raise em' up

So you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And then babies come
Raise em' up
Raise em' up

Raise em' up
Trophy high
Raise em' up
To the sky
Raise em' up
Show everybody that new born smile
Raise em' up
Tall and strong
Raise em' up
Right from wrong
Raise em' up so damn high they can hear God singing along

(Woah)
Everybody say we wouldnât make it baby
Love donât live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reason just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah, just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Put on a little ole Keith Whitley
Back porch dancinâ singinâ with me
Iâm no stranger to the rain, no, no we ainât
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah, just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Oh yeah
Oh baby, ainât we livinâ the dream

Look at us we got a life down here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last yearâs deer
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hanginâ
Kids in the back just a tire swinginâ
Fireworks a booming and banging
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Look at us with a picket fence
Donât got a lot of money but weâre makinâ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ainât doinâ half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby
Yeah just like that
Now, ainât we livinâ the dream

Oh, oh
Yeah

They say weâd never make it baby
Love donât live around here much lately
What do you think about that?
I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

He's a fast rushing river I can't get across
Like an ocean of sadness, o'er which I am tossed
He never slows down, he's always ready to fly
And when I get next to you it's just hello
Hello and goodbye

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

No rope can hold down
He's not fit to be tied
Like the wildest of horses
Nobody can ride

Freedom's his distance
And the means to his end
So I'm giving up trying
Cause I'm just chasing, chasing the wind

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

In his runaway heart
You've been sipping that wine on your back porch
All by yourself for way too long
You've been putting off getting out, shaking it off
And thinking 'bout moving on
No there ain't nothing worse than the way that it hurts
Your heart gets broke but the beat don't stop
Might still be cracked but it still works so let's dust it off

It's time to get back in the game, girl
Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name
It'd be such a shame, if you let one more night go by
Without showing everybody who the boss is
I got the perfect thing to kick it off with
A little late night neon light with some Dixie champagne, girl
It's time to get you back in the game, girl

You're way too pretty to be sitting on the sideline
Baby, there ain't no doubt
That you're the kind when you walk through the door, girl
Everybody's checking you out
In your little party dress, such a beautiful mess
There ain't no way that you don't know that
You were made to make me a wreck
C'mon, let's go

It's time to get back in the game, girl
Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name
It'd be such a shame, if you let one more night go by
Without showing everybody who the boss is
I got the perfect thing to kick it off with
A little late night neon light with some Dixie champagne, girl
It's time to get you back in the game, girl
Time to get you back in the game, girl

There ain't nothing worse than the way that it hurts
Your heart gets broke but the beat don't stop

It's time to get back in the game, girl
Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name
It'd be such a shame, if you let one more night go by
Without showing everybody who the boss is
I got the perfect thing to kick it off with
A little corner bar, come fill it up with some Dixie champagne, girl
It's time to get you back in the game, girl
Time to get you back in the game, girl
You're back in the game, girl
Time to get you back in the game, girl
Hey baby won't you tell me what you've got going on
Just a little later on tonight
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on, later on, later on

Girl you're shining like a movie star
And y'know you look so good
I can't stop starin'
And I can tell that you're feelin' it too
What you wanna do with that smile you're wearin'
Oh yea

What you say we got lost lets go
Spend a couple hours just gettin'
To know each other out there in the moonlight glow
And when we get alone

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on
Yea

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later
Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
Later on, later on, later on, later on, later on, later on

That come on feeling getting strong
Drink it up 'till it's gone
This is what we're waiting on
Later on, later on, yeah!
I had a fake ID that looked nothin' like me
But my jeep looked sweet up on 33's
I 'member chokin' on smokes down at the creek
and braggin' 'bout kissin' that homecomin' queen

Back in the day we were small town stars,
snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day we were draggin the strip, waitin' on green pop the clutch let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day

Heads and tails on a 50 yard line
Puttin' buck shot holes on a county road sign
Yeah, I fell in love a couple times
A couple of them girls still cross my mind

Back in the day we were small town stars,
snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day we were draggin the strip, waitin' on green pop the clutch let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day
Back in the day

There ain't nothin' really changed, naw
We're still doin' it up the same way
Just like we did yeah, back in the day

'Cause back in the day we were small town stars,
snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day we were draggin the strip, waitin' on green pop the clutch let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day

(Oh oh woahhhhh)
Not a care didn't worry 'bout a thing
(Oh oh woahhhhh)
As long as we had gas in the tank
(Oh oh woahhhhh)
That's how we did it back in the day
(Oh oh woahhhhh)
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

We were gonna dance till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Yeah, you act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burning the midnight down again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Every goodbye is bittersweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (sippin' on fire)

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me
Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
It took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you

I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore

Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause baby you don't sound like you anymore
Oh, anymore

That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you wanna come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you
Gimme the girl I knew
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore
Mmm, anymore

Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
Well I see the souls of so many friends,
And I see us all back here again.
With sandy floors and ceiling fans,
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fill my memories like a tip jar.
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar.

I see tourists at Christmas time,
And I taste beers with a hint of lime.
I feel lonely cause it's not the same,
Different faces and different names,
Living like pirates out among the stars.
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar.

Pieces of our past slowly slip away,
But time just stands still when I walk in this place.

And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on.
Somehow trying to find his way,
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart.
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar.

Pieces of our past slowly slip away,
But time just stands still when I walk in this place.

A few have moved on back to Maine,
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne.
Some are still living the dream,
Stuck in still life it seems.
No matter where they've been,
Or where they are,
Yeah, I see 'em here
When I see this bar.
When I see this bar.

I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life ain't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars
That's what I see when I see this bar

That's what I see when I see this bar
It's perfect outside. It's like God let me dial up the weather.
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever.
It's one of those never-forget-it-better-stop-and-take-it-in kinda scenes.
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing.

You should be here, standing with your arm around me here.
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers, hey y'all it's sure been a good year.
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it.
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here.

You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone.
Showing them off to everybody that you know back home.
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face.

You should be here, standing with your arm around me here.
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers, hey, y'all it's sure been a good year.
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it.
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
Aw you should be here.

You'd be loving this, you'd be freaking out, you'd be smiling, yeah
I know you'd be all about what's going on right here right now.
God, I wish somehow you could be here.

Oh, you should be here.

Yeah, this is one of those moments that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
Aw you should be here.
You should be here.
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby
When I am sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I am gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

I know it won't always be like this
Life can change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

And as the seasons change and time goes by
When your hair is gray and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today

Bring on tomorrow
I've got today
Bring on tomorrow
I've got today
Bring on tomorrow
Right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow
Because the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one, like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyear's and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me, flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world

Cause when you got love, like we got love

Strictly outta curiosity,
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me

Gimme any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got somethin' we could start tonight
Lookin' at you girl it's hard to fight

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback

Come on baby shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my lock screen
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we got the beat let's drop it

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
Tattoos, cutoffs and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works in your snapback

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
[x4]

I've been broken, torn and scattered
I've loved holy, I've loved sin
I was rolling on the wind
It didn't matter

I was so sure of who I didn't want to be
Every smile and every fear
Every laugh and every tear
It was all me, it was all me


[Chorus:]
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

We've all been lied to
We've all been liars
Nothing's perfect in this world
Everybody's been burned by the fire
Guess I'm learning
That what breaks you, makes you grow
But I'm not hiding where I've been
Gonna let the light shine in
What I don't need
Gonna let that, let that, let that go


[Chorus:]
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am

Pieces, the good and the bad
Pieces, the happy and sad
Pieces, the wrong and the right
Pieces, that's my, that's my, that's my life


[Chorus:]
Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

Pieces, pieces
They said I was nothing but a trouble maker never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you were sneaking out your window every night riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever and
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job I was working at a 9 to 5
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms I'd never felt so alive
I'd spend my days working, spend my nights drinking, howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back no couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee

And I said
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me
The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming a mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it to the T
Believe me I could sell it all day
It goes

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight, make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A clichÃ© in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight, make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight, make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

A guy walks into a bar
A guy walks into a bar
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the key's under the mat
When childhood stars shine,
Always stay humble and kind

Go to church 'cause your mamma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say "please", say "thank you"
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why:
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind

Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pick-up line
So always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say "please", say "thank you"
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind

Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're going don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say, "Hi"

And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong

Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No, girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with "Hello"
And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice
And some guy's getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
Got an alright house and a pretty nice yard
A screen door dog that stays on guard
Got a buddy up the road that's got my back
'Round here it ain't hard to find folks like that

Got a gun and a Bible by my bed
Try to live by the words in red
I ain't got a lot but I got enough
By God I believe, in God we trust

That's why, why we live here
Damn right, we ain't going anywhere
Home of the brave, baseball, and cold beer
It's pretty clear
That's why we live here

Right now there's a man serving overseas
Seeing things he wished he didn't see
Picture of his wife tucked in his vest
Fighting a fight we ain't finished yet

That's why, why we live here
Damn right, we ain't going anywhere
Home of the brave, baseball, and cold beer
It's pretty clear
That's why we live here, yeah

Whether your road
Is dirt or paved
Red, white, and blue
We're all the same

That's why, why we live here
Damn right, we ain't going anywhere
Home of the brave, baseball, and ice cold beer
It's pretty clear
That's why we live here
I don't mess with the monkey
Let him roll right off my back
I fly like a bee to the honies
Turn a bar to an all out love shack
Can I get an amen, a hallelujah
A little splash of the Coke in my Black Jack
Don't let this black-tie fool ya
I'm a down home groover, a midnight mover

Give me and my bulldog
Sitting on the front porch
Old man Willie be banging on the G-chord
Little girlfriend cooking up a chicken
Sipping on the liquor, everybody listening
'Round here got the laid back low-down
Little bit of Waylon, whole lot of Motown
Might sound just a little bit funky
But hey ya'll, that's my kind of country

I ain't hearing no lip son, drag ya
In the dirt like Tonka toy, boy
We don't play that where i come from
Hell yeah, I'm a momma's boy

Give me and my bulldog
Sitting on the front porch
Old man Willie be banging on the G-chord
Little girlfriend cooking up a chicken
Sipping on the liquor, everybody listening
'Round here got the laid back low-down
Little bit of Waylon, whole lot of Motown
Might sound just a little bit funky
But hey ya'll, that's my kind of country

Give me and my bulldog
Sitting on the front porch
Old man Willie be banging on the G-chord
Little girlfriend cooking up a chicken
Sipping on the liquor, everybody listening
'Round here got the laid back low-down
Little bit of Waylon, whole lot of Motown
Might sound just a little bit funky
But hey ya'll, that's my kind of country

It's my kind of country
It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush T-shirt
Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
You know what I'm talking about

Hey, baby, what you doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin'
That American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on, and on

It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad 'cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ, can you play that song
That she loves? So I can turn it up
And maybe turn her on
An American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on, and on

So let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets, to the ones that you ain't met yet

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on
I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why

This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
But feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few

But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight

They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
Well the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me

And I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
But feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

I can't unlove you
So come love me for now
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Happy man, baby
Mmm

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a Goddess,
The cutest, the hottest,
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true,
Nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah

I don't need no vacation,
No fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home,
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help
Got a hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
(Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair
(I know every curve like the back of my hand)
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see her sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

...she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town

You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
How'd you know to wear your hair like that?
How'd you know to turn up that song?
How'd you know them little tore up jeans
Was gonna tear me up and turn me on?
Girl, it's like you know me too good
But you barely know me at all
Yeah, the way it's going tonight
You probably know I'm ready to fall cause

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you know that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)

Girl it's like you got a crystal ball
Like you got a little gypsy side
It's like you knew that sweet perfume
That you got on was gonna get me high
Well how'd you know what I'm thinking right now?
How'd you know what I was about to say?
How'd you know to whisper in my ear
Let's take this party back to my place

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
Yeah, that's what you are

It's like you knew just when to lean on in
And take my hand like you had it all planned
And girl you've got me figured out, don't ya now?

Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind

Walking down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wandering eyes from looking at you
That's alright and that's okay
Who can blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty, and you ain't even got a clue

Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
What's your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show
You're the star of the show, yeah, baby

Friday night on the town
We walk in and you draw a crowd
Even the band seems to sing for you
Ease on up, order a drink, barkeep says its all on me
You look at me and laugh
Like you don't know what to do
Baby you're so cute

Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show, yeah
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah yeah

Even in a ponytail in a pair of jeans you look like a cover
Of a magazine, baby you're the only one who doesn't see

That everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl with the luckiest guy in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, baby
You are, you are, you are, you are
The star of the show..

Don't you know, you're the star of the show, baby
We had a good run
But I knew, I knew, I knew
I knew this day would come
As bad as I want to
Ain't no way, not me, girl
I ain't gonna stop you


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you, yeah

I'm gonna miss you
Baby, there's no way that I can go with you
So, go on and chase it
I know, I know, I know
You can almost taste it
Yeah, time's a wastin'


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you, yeah

It's gonna be a long night
And I might shed a tear
But I'm gonna be alright

And even though you won't be in my arms
You'll be right where you belong
So, go, girl, go, girl, go on


[Chorus:]
But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby, don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you
There's a cabin in a valley,
My grandpa built on your land.
Your mountains are a canvas,
For the makers hand.

Tonight I'm fishing Elk River,
If only in my mind.
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time.

I carry you in my heart
your memory comes over me like the dark and


[Refrain]
Like a phone call from my baby,
Sayin' honey I miss ya like crazy.
Like the sound of a siren song,
Oh Carolina, ya keep callin me home.
Callin' me home.

Sometimes I grow weary,
From goin' all the time.
I love to take a minute,
Let you ease my mind.

I'd love to see my mama
Maybe go for a drive
But I gotta play the star in some little town again tonight

Don't get me wrong
I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you


[Refrain]

Callin' me home
Callin' me home
Callin' me home, yeah

Oh, oh, we're almost home

Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin honey I miss ya, I miss ya like crazy
Just like the song of a siren song

Oh Carolina,
Carolina,
Carolina,
Keep callin me home,
Callin' me home,
Callin' me home,
Callin' me home

Carolina,
Carolina,
Keep callin' me home.
You're a crack of dawn Monday morning
Coffee strong pouring everything you got
Into a paycheck Friday night
You're a power stroke diesel backhoe riding
King of beers 18-wheeler driving
Livin' life in-between the lines of clocking in and quittin' time
Then the 6-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side on a night like this it just can't hide 'Cause it's dyin' to live it up so come on and raise your cup
If we talkin' 'bout memories yeah we gonna make 'em
Talkin' 'bout rules you know we gonna break 'em

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Yeah we all the same 'cause we thinkin' the same thing
We on the same page 'cause we sippin' the same drink
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Boy's blowin' it up
It's goin all night long
When the lights come on
Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling falling and the window stuck
But the only thing that I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in


[Chorus:]
Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find somethin' on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good a little outta tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she' d look at me, I'll never forget that melody


[Chorus]

Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey, man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on


[Chorus]

All we needed, all we needed now
Was a, was a, was a radio
My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like sheâs sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks but Iâm spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting cause itâs always getting hotter

Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like itâs Jamaica and Iâm sipping on some Red Stripe
But Iâm in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
(I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started melting so Iâll take another swallow

Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like Iâm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Iâm gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know

Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, letâs party like we on vacation

Sing it to me
Hey, letâs party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation
(Yeah dude, just party every time)
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


[Instrumental]

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
There's one sittin' in a pawn shop, glass counter, someone down in California traded it for a TV
Another one in a pretty blue box somewhere up in New York, white ribbon, Tiffany's
One's catchin' dust in a drawer in a dresser at your grandma's house that's been there since 1953
But honestly

A diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds

I ain't saying they aren't pretty and the way they feel doesn't feel just like an answer to a little girls dream
Ain't saying they ain't fun to show off to your friends and get the chills when you hear them scream
But if your hearts not in it, forget it

Cause a diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds

I don't need one just to hold on to
I don't want one unless it comes with you

Cause a diamonds just a diamond til you put it on the right left hand
Love is just a word til you feel it and finally understand
That some things don't mean anything til one day they mean everything
And you're flyin', smilin' and shinin'
Kinda like diamonds
Kinda like diamonds
Well I woke up in places I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
It's hard to believe that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time, right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road

And oh when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her

Now on a park bench down on 4th street, that's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped the ring on her hand
Oh, then a few short years later God put into my world
A six pound and an eight ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell ya now, I became a brand new man

Because when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing, yeah that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where, no matter where we are
Well I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her

Yeah I'm right at home when I'm holdin' her
Been sittin' here tippin' back Crown Straight
Workin' up the nerve and the words to say
To turn those eyes and that smile my way
No time to waste
'Cause you showed up and all eyes on you
Shinin' like a diamond in a neon room
Every guy here wants to make a move
I better make a move

Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will
Somebody else will

Maybe you're a little bit west coast
Maybe you're a little bit down home
Either way girl I just gotta know
I just gotta know

'Cause somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else is gonna hold you
Somebody gonna get to know you
If I don't get there and sweep you off your feet
Girl somebody else will
Ohh somebody else will

Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will baby
Ohh somebody else will
Yeah somebody else will
Somebody else will
He was sweet as cotton candy at a county fair
Well he's a cold drink of water with butterscotch hair
He swore that he loved me
Well I guess he probably did
'cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I saw my name next to his

A new tattoo stinging like a hornet
Two little hearts like a big red warning
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink, then comes the ring

Bye bye baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me

So now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart

Well he's a tough bronc buster
I bet he sleeps in his boots
Well he tried to throw a rope around me right out of the shoot
He swore that he loved me
Well I reckon he probably did
'cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I thought here we go again

A new tattoo burning like a brand
Two little hearts on my rodeo man
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink, then comes the ring

Bye bye baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me

Well now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart
I'm a free bird

A new tattoo whistling Dixie
Two little hearts ain't gonna get me
I'm not looking for a permanent thing
So don't shoot the ink 'til I take the ring

Bye bye baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me

Well now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a, skid marks and a
Skid marks and a double heart
Well, I'm a free bird
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air the California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

So I just hung around this little west coast town
I dropped by every night, I stayed till closing time
My little mystery, that girl is killing me
So I put on a song just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
You got the gas, I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild, you got the crazy
You know that's why I love you, baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

People talk, girl, you know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give 'em something they ain't never seen
A little rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset, baby
'Cause we ain't dead yet, baby

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here

We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah, we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here
Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would

I know it's hard on you
But like I always do

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy
Like a cowboy

Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Gimme half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Yeah, girl
Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high-heeled shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Yeah, girl
Got a little dirt on my boots

A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Charles Kelley:]
On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand
In the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts
Breaking necks
When we rolling down the street
Heads turning all day
When they see you with me


[Hillary Scott:]
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"

You look good (so fresh, so fine)
You look good
Got everybody watching you
Like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good


[Charles Kelley:]
Black dress to the 9s
New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof
Make the skyline spin

[Hillary Scott:]
Yeah, you're killing me, boy, in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me


[Charles Kelley (Hillary Scott):]
They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'

What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl. What you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink

So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling' off the top

And we'll go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band,
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab.
Girl, we got all night, I've got a bottomless tab
So let's goâ¦

Shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

It feels too good to let it end right here (I ain't going home alone home tonight)
So let's not let it end, let it end right here (girl, you're going home with me tonight)

So let's go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Well, I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight
Baby, don't let me go home alone
Home alone tonight
Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out

I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'mma go on and take a swing

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass

Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, laying next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
Yeah, you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around, spillin' their beer
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say we leave your friends with mine?
Oooh, oooh, yeah, they'll be alright
Oooh, I just wanna see you shine

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

Yeah, let me see you, girl

Whatcha think about takin' that chance?
Takin' a ride, takin' my hand?
Kickin' this crowd, ditchin' this club?
This night's been waitin' on us

Oooh, oooh, save your best moves
Oooh, yeah, til I get us where we're gettin' to

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

I could see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
Movin' your hips like wind moves cotton
You could get the whole wide country side hoppin'

Oooh, oooh, bring the beat back
Oooh, oooh, aww, come on with me, girl

Yeah, you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it, alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go, down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you, girl

Yeah, let me see you, girl

Come on, come on, come on, let me see you, girl
Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute
You got your hair down
You got that look in your eye
That says come here and get me boy
Lay me down and love me just right, yeah
Ainât goin no where
I got a bottle of wine
I got nothinâ but time on my hands
And Iâm gonna be your man tonight, ah yes I am


[Chorus:]

I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ

Itâs been a long week
Iâve been missinâ me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine
Girl if you only knew, hey


[Chorus:]

I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ
Yeah keep âem cominâ all night

Donât stop killinâ me baby
Donât stop drivinâ me crazy
I swear thereâs honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss


[Chorus:]

I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ
Oh keep âem cominâ all night, hey
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside, cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistlin' by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singin'

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singingâ¦

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinkin'
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles we're rollin' on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song

This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't

Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm

There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

All of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything

In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago, mmm
In case you didn't know, know, know
In case you didn't know
I got the truck warmed up, all gassed up
Rolling down the road at 3
Got on a sock cap, a saw in the back
Yeah, we're fixing to cut down a tree
Hey, timberrr!
You can smell the pine, every single mile
Get it on back to the house!
Shake off the snow, make it all glow,
Momma break the eggnog out!

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x2]

Front yard's blinking, whole town's singing
Rudolf and Jingle Bell Rock
Nana wants a snuggie
Papi wants some money
I just wanna drink a lot
Deceeeeember!
Got cookies in the oven
Everybody's coming
Party starts Christmas Eve!
Better hit the hay, Santa's on his way
Cause uncle cousin Johnny still believes!

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x2]

Hey
Timberrrr
Decemberrr

What time is it? Christmas time!
And you know cause it's getting cold outside
When the snow starts hitting, four wheel drive
Rocking on Christmas time!

[x4]

You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, girl, so I'm the one to blame, oh

Youâ¦ make all my screws comeâ¦ loose
Got me perfectly conâ¦ fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind

You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show me that apple, girl, and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get out of this straitjacket

Youâ¦ make all my screws comeâ¦ loose
Got me perfectly conâ¦ fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose myâ¦

I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you, yeah
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is I always have to guess (you know I do)

Youâ¦ you make all my screws comeâ¦ loose
Got me perfectly conâ¦ fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl

Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl

Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl

Yeah, that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up
My girl
In my heart, in my soul and the air that I breathe every day
That's my girl
Yeah, everything
My girl

Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin' you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl
Yeah, that's my girl
Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (mm-mm)
Dress sizes can't define, don't let the world decide what's beautiful
No

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Don't follow anyone,
March to the rhythm of a different drum
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones?
Oh

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on
Hey girl, you know what you've been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, whoever you've been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I'm what you need

I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good-ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

I'll be the high that never lets you down (I got your fix)
The one you crave when no one is around (I got your fix)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go, hey hey

Hey girl, he don't get you there never
So leave, oh just leave
Listen, baby baby baby baby girl
Let me make it feel better
Please, please, please, please
I'm what you need

I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good-ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

I'll be the high that never lets you down (that never lets you down)
The one you crave when no one is around (when no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go

Yeah, come on baby, yeah, oh oh oh
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one is around

I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good-ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

I'll be the high that never lets you down (that never lets you down)
The one you crave when no one is around (when no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go

[Keith Urban:]
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart

He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you


[Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood:]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter


[Keith Urban:]
Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one

To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you


[Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood:]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me, baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart


[Chorus - Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood:]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
If you don't take me to Paris
On a lover's getaway
It's all right, it's all right
If I'd rather wear your t-shirt
Than a sexy negligee
It's all right, it's all right
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be


[Chorus]
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
If your mother doesn't like
The way I treat her baby boy
It's all right, it's all right
If in every wedding picture
My daddy looks annoyed
It's all right, it's all right
Don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie
Real love and real life doesn't have to be


[Repeat Chorus]

You don't mind if I show up late for everything
And when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me
Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be


[Repeat Chorus]

It's good enough for me (perfect)
Yeah good enough for me (perfect)
Good enough for me (perfect)
I love it when we're at a party
In a down-town crowd
But I can't hear you call me, baby,
With the music up loud

Red wine,
Good times,
No, I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I--
I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background,
Underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

Oh, whoa,
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

And I wanna feel it like a kick drum,
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me
And make me hold my breath

You pull me closer,
My head on your shoulder,
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen-star wish,
One more slow kiss,
What are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background,
Underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me

Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me

You better believe it, you better believe it
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'm part of you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me

God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me
It's a gentle touch, but more than enough
She can stop this ole world from spinnin' too much
It's a natural thing and I do believe
I found my reason to be


[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

I'm not the same man since she's been around
There's more to this life, I've suddenly found
I look at myself now so differently
It's her love that brings me peace


[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

Whatever it is, I'll always be under her spell
She'll always be all I'll ever need
I could search the whole world
And I know I'd never find
Someone perfect as her for me

Suddenly it's something
You just can't live without
Oh, you know you found love
Beyond any doubt
With a simple man's words
I can never convey all that I feel when I say


[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

She's got a way with me
(She's got a way with me)
I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for

We had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart, and achin' head, and no regrets

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of "Just friends"
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Is this love
Or could it be
Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows sheâs gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, itâs a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Dayâs gone and the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs a seat laid back, a boyâs dream
Drawinâ hearts in the window steam
Sheâs a gettinâ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what youâre headed to
Whatâs a red blooded boy to do

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who
Didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just
Wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know, the bravest thing I ever did was
Run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could
Change his mind at any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that

I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
And I just miss you when I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

We might still be in love if you were a better man
Better man
Black pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down right now

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going
Quite like you do when you doin' the things that you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about

We went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancin'
Didn't take long, just a couple of songs
You know it's last call when the law comes walkin' in

So we went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off In a spot nobody else knows

We went taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44,
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn't want it to end

Black pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little of dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down right now
Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby let's just lose control
Lose control

I can handle
Every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you
Oh

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Real life
When it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby so

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep, yeah

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be, yeah
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep, yeah
Yeah we're winning when we're losing

Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart-shaped locket
Staring at a family, flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight

Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls, catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire

Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
And she's saying, and she's praying

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot-'em-up cowboys

Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the scorecard
And just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words like were little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Toy guns

Oh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang, bang
Make you wanna run...

Yeah, like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one
Just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Toy guns

Oh, like little toy guns
You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

Cause one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, "I'm just another fool and this is just another song"
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

Cause one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

Cause one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Ask me how I know
Cause man I know
We pass in the hall on our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life

I'm past the point of give a damn
All my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
We say "goodbye, see you around"
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up, we make up, and we make love
We can't seem to let go, girl

So I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure - save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is getting closer
I'm comin' over

I'm all alone, but you're on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you're at home
Who knows what we are in the morning
All I know is I want you

So I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure - save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is getting closer
I'm comin' over

Ooooh, I'm comin' over

Yeah, we said that we're done and I know that it's late
But you already know I'm on my way

I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure - save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire that's burnin'

I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure - save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is getting closer
I'm comin' over

Ooooh, I'm comin' over
Baby blue staring in the window pane
Just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress,
Now her heart's a mess
Praying she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night even like a lonely string of lights
That'll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There's more to this than just the breath you're breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

On the way down

You won't forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath and fly

Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Oh, oh
Fly
Fly
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes.
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me.
Another Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets.

No, I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you.
All messed up. All strung out. I was sitting at home breaking down.
Not out there getting high underneath some neon lights.
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right.
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night.

Besides the pain. I don't feel a thing.
When my buddies call me up I just let it ring.

No, I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you.
All messed up. All strung out. I was sitting at home breaking down.
Not out there getting high underneath some neon lights.
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right.
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night.

No, I'm not out there getting high underneath some neon lights.
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right.
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night.
Roll, won't you come roll with me slow, fast, full speed
Girl wherever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh

Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream, don't wanna be
Cruisin' through this dream without you


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, Oh Oh


[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up,
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, Oh Oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, Whoa Oh, Oh Oh

No other shotgun rider, Oh Oh

Singin' to the radio, Oh Oh

You're my shotgun rider.
I've got a pounding in my chest, baby
Feels like I'm 17 again
Have something burning a hole in my pocket lately
Done asked your daddy, done told your friends

I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do

I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine

Oh senorita, can't nothing be sweeter
Than you in that white wedding dress
Leaving that church in the limousine
Girl, why you crying, it ain't rocket science
All you gotta do is say yes
Spend the rest of your life with me girl

Don't you know that
I ain't gettin' down on one knee
Girl, I'm gettin' on two
Might be over the top
But I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do

I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine

Come on
Let's spend this life together
Dropping f-bombs like forever
With the whole world as a witness
Gonna flip that Ms. to Mrs.
Gonna spend this life together
Dropping f-bombs like forever
With the whole world as a witness
Gonna flip that Ms. to Mrs.

I'll put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine

Put a ring on every finger
Just to show you I'm legit
Go on try my last name on girl
Just to see if it fits
If I could baby I would
Marry you a million times
Put a ring on every finger
Just to show the whole world that you're mine
Show the whole world that you're mine
Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows sheâs gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, itâs a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Dayâs gone and the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs a seat laid back, a boyâs dream
Drawinâ hearts in the window steam
Sheâs a gettinâ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what youâre headed to
Whatâs a red blooded boy to do

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

Sheâs telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nightâs on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire

You try to play it cool but the nightâs on fire
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the Heartland just swallow em up?

How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other, that was enough

You know you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat your life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

What am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up

Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's what's up

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat you life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking, no matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading, you gotta treat you life like
You're jumping off a rope swing baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love love love love... like there's no such thing
You gotta love love love love... as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[CHORUS]
Things are tough all over
And I'm losin' badly
I wish you were still here
And I said it sadly
But if you wanna come back
Cause you need a shoulder
Things are tough all over

Guess I should count my blessings
For the life i still have
In a world of misfortune
That can happen so fast
Life size dominoes
One falls after another
Things are tough all over

Baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well, I hope you're not turnin'
On the other side of town
Cause things are tough all over

Well, baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well I hope you're not hurtin'
On the other side of town


[REPEAT CHORUS]

Things are tough all over
Things are though
Tough
Things are tough
Yeah, things are tough
Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We're gonna castaway tonight

I'm in an island state of mind
Don't think I'm ever gonna leave
I'd rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We're gonna castaway tonight
Castaway

Ride the waves like we're young
'Cause time flies by and soon we'll be older
It's better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I've been)
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I'll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I've been)
Make it a double rum
We're gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I'll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I've been)
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I'll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I've been)
Make it a double rum
We're gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I'll be a castaway)
Castaway
Home is where my heart is still beating
And I don't know when I'll see her again
I hate to see her cry when I'm leaving
But now I'm a thousand miles away again

And she feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina

It's hard to understand the way I'm living
And I know she thinks I'm never coming home (never coming home)
But I miss her pretty smile, I'm coming back in a little while
But I'm a thousand miles away again

And she feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away

No matter how far I go, you know I can't stop thinking about her
And there's nothing like the way I feel, the way I feel when I'm beside her


[2x]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

She feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away

Carolina (Carolina)
California (California)
Like home's not so far away

She feels like Carolina (Carolina)
Looks like California (California)
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

But...
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But...
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It's easy to give in to your heart
When you're drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were...

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said "Do you think we'll live forever?" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we wereâ¦

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Yeah and we were up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

World on fire
We were setting
The world on fire
We were setting
The world on fire
World on fire
She's a wild rose waiting on me at the end of the road
Between the water tower and the power lines
We're a cloud of dust once I get her buckled in my pickup truck
She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A Hollywood looker in a John Deere cap


[Chorus]
I go fast, she hollers faster,
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

Burning the backroads, sucking jet fuel from the radio
Cows and corn fields flying by
Gate's locked, hop the fence
Sneak past the barn where the riverbank bends
She's the best skinny dipper that you're ever gonna find
She can hit the branch with her bra every time, and


[Repeat Chorus]

She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A long straight away on a quarter mile track
She got a kiss that'll hit you like a heart attack
I got the rifle she's got the rack and


[Repeat Chorus two times]

She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory, more than saying "I do",
Kiss you goodnights and "I love you's"

Me and you, baby, walk in the footsteps
Build our own family
One day at a time
Ten little toes, a painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you

And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up

This life will go by
In the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain

And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up

Someday we'll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won't trade for nothing the life that we built
I'll kiss you goodnight and say, "I love you still."

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up
Well, I've been living like a wild old mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might've earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So unreigned, so untamed, yeah

So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

Your soul is pure golden
Must've been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you...

It's been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn't make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made

Girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah
More girls like you
Yeah

Yeah

More girls like...
Yeah

More girls like you
Yeah
The smile, the charm, the words, the spark,
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart,
'Cause, boy, I let you have it

You said I was your only,
Never thought you'd leave me lonely

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now it's "Happily Ever Never"
I guess now I know better

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

You're just a lost boy,
Yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy,
Too busy chasing stars

And you're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man

You're never gonna grow up
Yeah, you're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

Never gonna be a man
I hope that I ain't callin' too late baby
Hope you ain't closed those pretty blue eyes
Have you looked out of your window lately?
That moon's taken up half of that sky

Whoa, whoa!
I'm a little bit restless
Can't get you off of my mind
Oh!

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
A little bit of you right now

Got my wheels pulling off that highway
My headlights pointing down your street
I got your song cranked up on the radio
But you ain't singing sitting next to me, yeah

Whoa, whoa!
Girl I need you now
Walk on out!

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
Yeah

Oh, I could use a little bit of your heartbeat on mine
Your head on my chest all night long

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of your love, your smile
That thing you do that drives me wild
Your kiss, your touch
I could use a little, I could use a little bit of you right now
I wanna put my arms around a little bit of you right now
Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
âCause there wasn't sh!t to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
But our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and two trees
Whoa oh oh oh oh
But it ain't like what's on TV
Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life

We got a dive bar
With a real band, they play too loud
And they're real bad
But we're real bored so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems but we do too so we tip her anyway

That's just the way that it is Whoa oh oh oh oh
That's just the way that we live Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life
Yeah we're livin' real life

We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, let's make a deal
I guess it just got real
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life
This ain't no fairy tale, it's real life
Right now we both know
We're Marina del Rey,
Plane's gonna fly away
And you'll be on it

And by this time tomorrow
I'll be singing yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it

So before we turn in, I can't make you love me

Let's be Brown-Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before you lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry,
But that's a song for another time

Well, just for one more day
What do you say?
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
And let's take a drive
You and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those pink houses

Yeah, we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're...

Brown-Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before you lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon you'll be always on my mind,
But that's a song for another time

So before we're singing I Will Always Love You

Let's sing Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before you lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry,
But that's a song for another time

Yeah, that's a song for another time
Brown-Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Hey, that's a song for another time
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night
That's a song for another time
We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach â Iâd rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, thatâs not true

But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

Weâll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
Weâll play Jack Johnson, heâs the new Don Ho
And weâll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio

'Cause you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
You know it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Oh, hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love

You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy

You make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and sip tequila all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Tell me now, who needs Mexico?
Baby let's stay home
Baby let's stay home

Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...

Go on a little holiday...
Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess
She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows
Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so alive
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

She loves me wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so alive
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

She'll be here until she runs
Some just have to chase the sun

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so alive
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

A kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
So simple yet experimental
Innocent but still a little wild child

Wild child
The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, on your love
On your love
On your love, on your love
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk
Flame
Girl you light it up
When I hear you say my name
Yeah, you know just
How to start it

You shine
And I just can't wait
To get you out tonight
Yeah, you know
How bad I want it
Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stop light
No lookin' back
Wherever we're going
Gotta get there fast

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

Down, we can get down someplace
Just outside of town
Bring a bottle if you wanna
That moon, that moon ain't gonna
Tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna

Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stop light
No lookin' back
Wherever we're going
Gotta get there fast

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

No, I can't get you
Outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(Woah, oh, oh, oh)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red red red red red
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I'm tipsy
And I ain't even had a drink

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning, morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeahhh, I like a little Captain in my coke.
You know I like a little good time in my smoke,
With a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate,
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road,

I like fried chicken right off the bone,
I like my peaches home grown.
Pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing,
With a little Garth on the radio.

A little bit of Florida,
A little bit of Georgia,
And a whole lot of country in my soul.

You see my roots are buried deep down in the south.
And these boots don't get muddy from sittin' around.
Out here in the holler, we work hard for a dollar,
From sun up to sun down.

Well I ain't been handed a thing from the man,
And all that I own I got with my own hands.
I work hard and play hard so don't be alarmed,
That's just who I am.

Yeahhh, I like a little Captain in my coke.
You know I like a little good time in my smoke,
With a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate,
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road,

I like fried chicken right off the bone,
I like my peaches home grown.
Pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing,
With a little Garth on the radio.

A little bit of Florida,
A little bit of Georgia,
And a whole lot of country in my soul.

Yeah, my way of life is from Jesus to Jones.
I've got fire in my blood and desire in my bones.
I am who I am and I don't give a damn,
'Cause that's just how I roll.

I like a little Captain in my coke.
You know I like a little good time in my smoke,
With a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate,
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road,

I like fried chicken right off the bone,
I like my peaches home grown.
Pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing,
With a little Garth on the radio.

A little bit of Florida,
A little bit of Georgia,
And a whole lot of country in my soul.

Yeah, I like a little Captain in my coke.
You know I like a little good time in my smoke,
With a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate,
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road,

I like fried chicken right off the bone,
I like my peaches home grown.
Pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing,
With a little Garth on the radio.

A little bit of Florida,
A little bit of Georgia,
And a whole lot of country in my soul.

In my soul, In my soul, yeahhh,
In my soul, Yeah.

A little bit of Florida,
A little bit of Georgia,
And a whole lot of country in my soul!
Hey to the weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightening hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
And they'll all wanna dance
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandana; she was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me onto Back Porch Pickers, Jackson, Pollack and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions, so he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges, and I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood

They're standing in lines, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)

I'm a dirt road
In the headlights
I'm a mama's boy
I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line
Kinda cold beer
Little hat down
Little John Deere

You see the girl standin' right there

Likes to slow dance
To some old school
She'll take a full moon
Over them city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah I can smooth it out
I can slick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough

Of a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby

He pulled up in his red Corvette
Salmon shorts and a white V-neck
I said, "Wow, you know how to dress down for a city guy."

We headed out to a spot on the lake
A couple Zebcos and a cup full of bait
I could tell pretty fast he had more than just bass on his mind

Oh, I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and trying to hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

For a little while he calmed down and let up
But then he went right back to pushing his luck
That line of mine wasn't all I wanted to throw in
Oh, no

I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and trying to hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

I finally had all of him that I could take
So I gave him a cold shower in the lake

What can I say?

I was fishing
He was wishing
We were kissing
I was getting madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Getting closer
Sliding over
Playing captain Casanova

[Alternative version:]
Crowding up my casting shoulder
Reaching out and tryna hold my reeling hand

[Alternative version:]
Trying to reach out and hold my reeling hand

Saying I'm pretty
Saying he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, "Yeah, it could,
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish."

Just a little push
'Cause he couldn't just
Shut up and fish
Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No make-up on, shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right

Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross out finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candlelight
Come slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Oh, I wanna say it again

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy
Easy
Easy
It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.

Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.

To Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

Like a stone, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause, that's just the deal,
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,

Rockin' Randall, gettin' rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
'Til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.

When the winds grow cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars, my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind

Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raise the
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turn it up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.
We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines, the coal mines
And the steel mills
That's what we do but there's more to us than that
If you wanna know who we are
It's on the logos of our caps

We're Mountaineers, we're Volunteers
We're the Tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're a herd of Longhorn steer
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Cheer 24 and 88
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We might fix your water pump or your AC
Bring your apple pie and fill your glass of tea
We'll take that FedEx package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform

We're Wildcats, we're Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer 14 and 48
And we drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We're all across the map, down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation all our own

We're Mountaineers, we're Volunteers
Blue Devils, Heels and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We soup up our Chevrolets
Cheer 24 and 88
We crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
I am insensitive, I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I don't know why you stay with me.

I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
And I wish that I could be more like you.

I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
Well, I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.
Love me good.

Girl, you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted,
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.

You love me good.
Right there's the high school where we met
We'd sneak out back for a couple kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too late

She's gone
Chasing that highway wind
She's gone
She ain't coming back again

This ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bringing me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

We sat down on those courthouse steps
Fourth of July those fireworks over our heads
And they'd ring the bells of that little church
No there ain't nowhere I can look that doesn't hurt

She's gone
But I still feel her on my skin
She's gone
But she ain't coming back again

This ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bringing me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

I can't erase the memories
And I can't burn the whole place down

No this ain't nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
To hell if I'm sticking around
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town
Oh yeah
Out of this goodbye town
I'm out of this town
So out of this town

Oh oh oh oh oh...

You'll be just a memory in the back of my mind
You'll be just a memory yeah
Oh, somewhere in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind, yeah
One day you're gonna look back at what we had
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me
When I'm long gone
I'll be long gone
I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Seems like your memory, has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
It's driving me crazy

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh oh oh

Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, you still got me surrounded,
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mmm, outta my head

No you ain't gone,
No you ain't gone,
Yeah outta my head
That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in a closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in a closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

(Out to dry)
(To the line)

oh, oh
Everybody knows I like whiskey
Preferably from Tennessee
But if you hand me an ice cold beer
Or some red wine, or some moonshine
Or one of them fruity drinks
Hell, that's alright with me

God knows I love women
The devil knows they make me weak
And I might find the right one
And settle down in a little town
Or I might just stay wild and free
And that's alright with me


[Chorus:]
I like whiskey and tight denim
On good hearted women
And for that I make no apologies
Call me country, call me hippie
A wildcat from Dixie
And if you do or don't like what you see
That's alright with me

There's nothing quite like the ocean
With a little tent and a little beach
And I like sitting 'round the campfire with my guitar
And if somebody wants to pass around some green
Hell, that's alright with me


[Chorus:]
I like whiskey and tight denim
On good hearted women
And for that I make no apologies
Call me country, call me hippie
A wildcat from Dixie
And if you do or don't like what you see
That's alright with me

I just slip on my cheap sunglasses
And let the world do it's thing
And even if it's all just death n' taxes
Well, that's alright with me


[Chorus:]
I like whiskey and tight denim
On good hearted women
And for that I make no apologies
Call me country, call me hippie
A wildcat from Dixie
And if you do or don't like what you see
That's alright with me

That's alright with me
She puts her boots and bandanna on
She has a hankering for Rolling Stones
She likes her vegetables home grown
A lot like the boy waiting out in the truck

She'll take a hill like Roosevelt
Holds up her pants with a Bible belt
She cracks 'em up like a liberty bell
A whole lot of tender and a little bit tough

Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's American beautiful

Well, he is a mutt with a pedigree
Sinatra junkie in a pair of jeans
He pays his dues in the Land of the Free
Says, "Why walk? Baby, we were born to run."

Ooh, ooh, ooh
He's a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
He's American beautiful

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I saw that girl in a mirror once
With a boy like that in a cloud of dust
I think they look a lot like us
'Cause we are, we are, we are

Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are American beautiful

Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
We are a little unusual
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We are American, American, American beautiful
I know I just met you
Been talking your ears off
But I wanna know everything
And I got all night long

Are you tryna be someone for someone?
'Cause you remind me of where I come from
So boy, I know it's kinda soon
But I'll tell you what I wanna do

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy, I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Daddy's gonna love you
He'll probably talk your ears off
Drive you by the little church
That saved me when I got lost
Take you down roads that I grew up on
Wish on those stars I used to wish on
Kiss you on the bleachers on the 50 yard line
Boy, you know, I...

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Oh, I ain't tryna jump the gun
Sure ain't tryna make you run
But the second I saw you
I knew I had to get you alone

I wanna take you home and I ain't talking
'Bout a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up, one and done on a Friday
No, boy I'm talking 'bout a map dot town nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow

I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

And tell you 'bout me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home

[Faith Hill:]
She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklin's, she wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money, it's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there when she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama, respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman and that's how you speak to a girl


[Tim McGraw:]
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just wanna feel that you're real, that she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne, that she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying


[Tim McGraw & Faith Hill:]
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with a lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama, respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl

That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with a lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama, respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman and that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
Rearview crosses
Railroad ties
Oh, Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God, I miss when you were mine


[Chorus:]
Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine


[Repeat Chorus]

In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss


[Repeat Chorus]

Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I can feel your heartbeat, baby
I'd sell my soul just to see your face.
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain.
In these times I need a saving grace, but time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith.

But if I told you I loved you, would it make you want to stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and making you walk away.
(I should have took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day, would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you, wanna stay?
(Girl you gotta know I love you)

My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black.
(I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone)
Without your touch I'm not gonna last.
(I know you know that I need ya just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in.
(You'd always hold me before I left you hanging on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again.

But if I told you I loved you, would it make you want to stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and making you walk away.
(I should have took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day, would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)

Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long.
And I can't stand to be alone.
Please know this is not your fault.

And all I want...

Is to tell you I love you and make you wanna stay.
There's gotta be a way, 'cause going on without you is killing me everyday.

And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day, would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you, wanna stay?
(Girl you gotta know I love you)
Would it make you, make you, wanna stay?
(I can't go another day without you)

Would it make you, make you, wanna stay?
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really shouldn't be

Give it one more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone and I'm picking up the phone

One more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer

Stay a little longer

Wishing you could stay a little longer...
Sitting on the front step, little white suitcase
Hearing that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burning down a Friday night
Southern bell statue standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye

Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window

Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

Bowling alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Staring at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby two weeks ain't really all that long

Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry for him out the window

Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

In a love triangle, yeah

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies
Let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love triangle

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

You and me, baby, on the run
I can feel your heartbeat, baby
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl...
You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes

Tonight let's raise 'em up
To where we ended up

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here.
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

I didn't have much money but I covered them rounds
'Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fellow throw his money down
You weren't shooting whiskey just shootin' the shhh...
I paid the tab, we walked out the door and I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here,
Oh, it all started with a beer. Yeah.
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

Here's to you, baby. Oh-oh-oh.

So tonight let's raise 'em up
To where we ended up

There's been highs and lows,
Fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven,
Lost it all when we rolled some sevens
Been more smiles than there's been tears,
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy, baby, how we got here,
Oh, it all started with a beer. Oh.
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer. Oh. Yeah.
Oh

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer.
Oh.
You got your girls, and I got my boys
You got your gotta see this pin it on Pinterest
While we're out makin' noise
You got your chick flick, we got the game
You got your getcha tan on all day long
While I'm fishin' off a tailgate


[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

You got the tank top, and I got the jeep
We got an open road and a radio
With no place to be
You got that smile, and I got your hand
Oh, and if you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
I think you understand


[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

No, I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Yeah, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Girl, that's for sure
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
'Cause I wanna be so much more


[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

Baby, let me show you again
I don't wanna be your friend
No, I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be

[CHORUS:]
This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya
(Whoa)
Ain't gonna let you down
(Whoa)
Just wanna make you proud
This is for my people back home
My people back home
My people back home

See this one's for my people
From the backwoods to the steeple
From my daddy and that preacher man
That taught me to run from evil
From the people that I'm still so cool with
And the people that I went to school with
From the boys I ran around and stomped them grounds and broke them rules with
This one's for my family and the way that I was raised
And now my life's another city, another picture, another stage
But I hope you know I miss ya
And part of me's still with ya
And no matter where I go or what I do I won't forget ya


[CHORUS]

This is for the one's who believed in me
For the one's who took the time to breathe the life in me
You got my heart beating inside of me
You made me what I tried to be
For the one's who love my music
Said you could do it, if you choose this
So we dreamed big and we worked hard
Now we got the whole world cruisin'


[CHORUS]

For my brother and my sister
For my mama yeah I miss her
For the one that got away
Damn, I should have kissed her
For my best friends and my cousins
And that town that we grew up in
If it wasn't for all of ya'll
This ole boy would be nothing

You're running through our hearts
You did it from the start
Yeah you know who you are
You're in every song I sing
You're in every dream I dream
You're the beat inside of me


[CHORUS]

Talk on the phone, stare at the screen
Doin' the job, livin' the dream
Gettin' paid
Yeah right
Thinkin' about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight

Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away
Let's conversate
For a little while
Well, keep me company, catch me up
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time nine to five
I'd rather see you smile

Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Well, it's been a long day
And the boss don't get it
Don't you wanna take the edge off
With some seven and seven?
Just crushin' on a friend
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sippin' and tippin' some drinks after work?

A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
What's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Long Day
No break
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
Sippin' and tippin' some drinks after work
I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And thatâs how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I got friends that say I live a little like cool hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But hey on Sunday morning I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals fresh cut hay fields and hometowns

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
Hey, y'all, is that my dog up on the roof?
And, good God, why's my car out in the pool?
All I 'member was a phone call, now the party's on
Somebody knockin' at my door

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night...

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess,
Oh Man, who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night,
But we musta had a good time

Hey y'all why's my bed not in my room?
And, good God, how did my face get black and blue?
All I remember was a bring it on, a pour it strong,
And the girls all getting down!

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess, Oh Man,
Who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

Now I don't know what the hell went on round here last night,
But we musta had a good time!

I sure could use a cold one, right about now...

Cause I'm picking up beer cans,
Oh Man, somebody's passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
But, we musta had a good time!

Heh, heh, heh... yeah we musta had a good time!
We SHORE had a good time!
We always have a good time!
I could tell by the way you sounded when you called
That I wasn't going to like what you had to say
I could read between the lines there was something different this time
You're coming over tonight âcause you couldn't wait
Now you're in the drive, I'm a wreck inside as you walk in through that door

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me
You look like I need a drink

Been little over a year since you were standing right here
And I was nervous for a whole ânother reason
Now it's a little bit hard being this caught off guard
Watching you trying to not hurt my feelings

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me
You look like I need a drink

You look like I need a drink

I don't know how this ends or where this goes
But the only thing I know is

You look like I need a drink right now
You look like you're gonna try to let me down nice and easy
I think I know why you won't sit down
You're just dancing around what you came here to do but you're scared to
And all I can think, the way you're looking at me,
you look like I need a drink
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town,
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around.
Moonshine, that's where they make it,
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked.
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line.
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able
Don't know what makes you say "What the hell"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just wanna dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
Pirate flag and an island girl

Well I remember back home 'neath the big ol' moon
Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinkin' shooting stars

I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playinâ, everyone went home
But the stars are still out and youâre so damn hot
And I ainât ready for the music to stop


[Chorus:]
Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockinâ âtil the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, âOh hell yeah!â
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along cominâ on
Baby be my love song

Girl, fast or slow, three-quarter time
It donât have to make sense
And it donât have to rhyme
As long as itâs you
Babe, Iâm all in
And when itâs over
Just play it again


[Repeat Chorus]

Baby be my melody
My little feel good that gets to me
Donât be shy baby, set it free
Crank it up, hit me way down deep


[Repeat Chorus]

I feel a little sing-along, sing-along cominâ on
Baby be my love song
Baby be my love song, oh yeah
Be my love song
Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio I'm ready to roll

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes

Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio I'm ready to roll

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
My grandpa taught me about buck knives and shotguns
How to cast an old Zebco, how to work a stick shift
He taught me the Bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this

With pearly gates
Streets of gold
He said if I just believe
That's where I'll go

But Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honeybees and blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

Now it says in the King James in the almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'll gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded, and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings

When I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honeybees and blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven... yeah

Yeah, the good Lord knows me, he knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you got it all together
So if you don't mind I'd like to know you better

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe Iâm just getting old
Used to work but now it donât
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn and you donât know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
Thatâll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldnât roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

I wish I didnât know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isnât working
But I havenât lost all hope yet
Yeah itâs hurting but it ainât dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldnât roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldnât roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song
I got my shades on, top back
Rolling with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shining of the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowing in, your hair blowing round
You're scanning through the stations looking for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

I got my shades on, top back
Rolling with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl, you so fine I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses, you got me missing signs
Hard looking left when my world is on my right

I got my shades on, top back
Rolling with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where i wanna be

I got my shades on, top back
Rolling with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Yeah, I love rocking with you when, girl, we're just chilling it
Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof
Talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls
Girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side I'd be dreamin' with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

I bet that DJ'S playin' your song and your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin' home to

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you
Ya no matter how late baby
I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you no

Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you

Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Yeah, you know I love you in a tight dress
But you're, oh my God, slippin' out of it
You turn me on, girl, you know you do
But you tear me up even better in boots

We ain't gotta worry 'bout gettin' dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby, put your Luccheses on
You know you want to
'Cause we got a full moon
And it's Friday night
Girl, you got me so hooked
Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots

Fair, girl, it ain't even fair
When all it takes is you lettin' down your hair
To drive me wild like you know you do
It works every time but even better in boots

We ain't gotta worry 'bout gettin' dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby, put your Luccheses on
You know you want to
'Cause we got a full moon
And it's Friday night
Girl, you got me so hooked
Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots

We ain't gotta worry 'bout gettin' dirty
We can do whatever we want
Baby, put them Luccheses on
You know you want to
'Cause we got a full moon
And it's Friday night
Girl, you got me so hooked
Ain't nothin' ever looked better in boots
Girl, you got me so hooked
Ain't nothin' ever looked better in them boots
When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton,
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shocking

Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap boots and jeans
Not everybody goes to church or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to "Ring Of Fire" or "Amazing Grace"


[Chorus:]
Oh, Dixie Land,
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee Home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my Southern Comfort Zone

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me,
To take a good hard look around and be a minority

And I Miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my Southern Comfort Zone

I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, You have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White

I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back


[Solo]


[Chorus:]
I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside My Southern Comfort Zone

Look away, look away

I wish I was in Dixie, away, look away
Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same

You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road

Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight, yeah
Yeah, boy

Yeah, boy

Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

Yeah, boy
Bet you think I'm sitting at home. No.
Bet you think that I'm all alone. No.
Bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone,
Hell, no!

I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't ever got me.
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

Heard you called my boys,
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But, girl, I ain't even close

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't ever got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now,
On a beach towel
With my shades on
My drink's up
And the sun's out
Huh! I'm somewhere on a beach!

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.
I guess I said some thing's last night
That usually in the morning light
I regret
Like double shots and cigarettes
Said things like
"I love you baby" and
"I know I sound crazy but let's just work this out ya and maybe settle down"

I woke up hungover
But still had to call you
Cause I just realized girl
That maybe it was all true
Yeah

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
That it didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah I can lie about 99 percent of the time
When I've had too much to drink
Yeah I do stupid things

But this time is different
And baby it feels so right
I hope you were listening
To every word I said last night

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
That it didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah I got blood shot eyes
(Got blood shot eyes)
But it's all crystal clear
(All crystal clear)
Well I know I don't need Jim Beam
To know I need you here

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
And I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
Baby all I know is I still need you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

Yeah baby I'm stone cold sober

Come on over
When the lights go down
When you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio

And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet

Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

So Come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, Tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field, where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

So Come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, Tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

So Come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little bit of beer money
Tonight, Tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

So come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

It's yours if you want it

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby your name is written on it
Baby it's yours if you want it
Here we go

Yeah

I don't wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Things you gotta do, places that you gotta go, oh no

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night

We can rock together, let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup make a memory, drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you
Neath the blue sky fallin' in love

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night

I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket cause you just got paid, baby

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night
Hey, your Friday night
Hey, your Friday night
Your Friday night
I was sitting on a bar stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tear stains on his old shirt
And he said you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First night in jail with Charlie
It sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
Well I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said wait a minute that's not all there's even more

You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the bail and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song
Woo!

We sat there and shot the bull about how it would be
If we could turn it all around and change this C-R-A-P

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
You get the farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First night in jail with Charlie
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the bail and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards

[Dierks Bentley:]
She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, "I gotta get laid tonight."
She don't say, "It's okay, I never loved him anyway."
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid


[Both:]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on

[Dierks Bentley:]
But it's different for girls


[Elle King:]
She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go

[Both:]
She won't call just to curse, find a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough

It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls


[Dierks Bentley:]
It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there


[Both:]
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough

[Dierks Bentley:]
So tough
It's different for girls

[Elle King:]
It's different for girls
One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull one more bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull one more bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull one more bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
I got a piece of land, out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun
Warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave?
âCause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms âround me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need and nothing that I donât
Homegrown, Homegrown

We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle
Livin' like weâll never die
Come on and stay a while if you donât believe me
Why would I ever leave?
âCause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms âround me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need and nothing that I donât
Homegrown, Homegrown
Homegrown, Homegrown

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown

It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things you think you want

I got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
She's a small-town, hard-working woman just trying to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths in a run-down kitchen
When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

She said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I need a stiff drink"
"Sipping from a highball glass"
"Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I need a long drag"
"Yeah, I know it might sound bad"
"But sometimes I need a smoke break"

He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son, do something good that matters

He said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I wanna pop that top"
"Take a swig and make the world stop"
"And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I wanna light it up"
"Yeah, when things get tough"
"Sometimes I need a smoke break, yeah"

So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup,
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
Baby what's on your mind,
When you see me pull up to your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown,
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country,
and maybe blow all our money
on some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy.
And tell me now,

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light,
Go to Vegas, stay up all night,
See if we can find a cheap flight,
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice?
Do I make you feel pretty,
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me,
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show.
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now?
We can take it back downtown,
You know I don't care now.
Just wanna take you there now.

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,
Girl when I come around tell me,
Do I make you wanna?

Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Broadway?
Tell me do I make you wanna
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth.
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down,
Play a little truth or dare now,
Act just like you don't care now,

Baby,

Go flyin' down a two lane road.

Ah, babe, tell me,
Do I make you wanna?
Don't ya hate hearin' that clock on the wall chiming,
Sayin' it's time
And don't you just wish we could just stay right here together
All day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawl back into bed
Got as close as we could get
Tryin' to figure out where this thing is goin'


[Chorus:]
Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leavin
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it goin on
And I just can't believe it
This feelin' it just keeps gettin' stronger

If ya gotta go
You gotta know
I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're livin' every kiss
You ain't leavin me like this
It just ain't right
Wait until tonight
To lite another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burnin' this mornin


[Chorus]

Love, no one else can love me like you do.
You know, I ain't even close to through- lovin you.


[Chorus]

Don't
Baby, Baby don't
No baby don't

(Baby, baby, ohhhh, baby, baby don't)

Ohhhhh no, no, baby don't

(Baby, baby, ohhhh, baby, baby don't)

Ya, Don't.
Baby, Baby, Don't.
If it ainât broke, you can bet that Iâm gonna break it
If thereâs a wrong road, Iâm damn sure gonna take it
Where thereâs smoke, my pocket lighter sparked the fire
Where thereâs blue lights, just read me my rights

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

Where thereâs a love, I tell ya, girl, I love to hate it
Where thereâs a do not touch, my finger print done stained it
Where thereâs a train wreck, sit on back and watch me crash
Where thereâs a what, you say, damn right I said it

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

For breaking your heart, taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud, where thereâs a scar I carved it out

No, they donât make guys like me, you get exactly what you see
I come from a long line of bloodline that ainât gonna change
So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger
I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame

I know where to aim, hell, Iâm to blame
Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around, well
I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are sayin' you wanna disappear, well
I know a place and I know somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

I'm lovin' the way you act so shy
Like you ain't sure, like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends that you know somebody
That makes you laugh, that can get you home
That might make you fall âfore the night is gone
So come on, you know I'm that somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

That's lookin' for a girl like you
Could fall in a kiss or two
Baby tell me what you wanna do
Cause I know

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Oh, whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh, baby, I need you now
We're just back porch sitting
Doing some old school picking
Got some brand new strings on my Gibson
Yeah, I'll play your favorite song

The cooler's down to the last drop
But it won't last that way long
'Cause Tommy's making a beer run
So baby, come on

We're in good company
Yeah, the only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
So B.Y.O.B, it means bring yourself over, babe
Got what we need to make good vibes, good times
And a damn good memory
We're in good company
Yeah, yeah we're in good company

Well, the pool's full, come on get in it
Got a hole, throwing bean bags in it
And Robby's painting on the brisket
It's a K.C. masterpiece

You know they make Saturday's
For doing whatever you want
The weekend's where it begins
So baby, baby come on

We're in good company
Yeah, the only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
So B.Y.O.B, it means bring yourself over, babe
Got what we need to make good vibes, good times
And a damn good memory
We're in good company, yeah
Oh, in good company, yeah, come on

We got them good vibes
Them good times
And damn good memories
We got that good wine
Off that good vine
It's a damn good night to be

In good company, yeah
The only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you

We're in good company
Yeah, the only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
So B.Y.O.B, it means bring yourself over, babe
Got what we need to make good vibes, good times
And a damn good memory
We're in good company, yeah
We're in good company, oh, yeah
We're in good company

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Somebody said they saw you walkin up out the salon
Switchin up your hair, got your "freak 'em" dress on
Photo shoot fresh like you about to perform
And I'm a fuckin mess, I had you on my arm
Woke up you was gone, I can't even blame ya
Now you in the arms of a stranger
And now I'm all alone with this anger
You used to feel safe, now I'm danger
'til when you had to leave, without a warnin
Such a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten, I can't even pretend
You used to love me, but now you want him


[Hook: Florida Georgia Line]
And I hope you're happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)


[Verse 2: Nelly]
Girl you got me out here stressin, I'm on some manic depressant
I'm switchin up how I'm feelin, I'm listenin to suggestions
And your expression is mute
But your nose all up in the air, how cute
And I could write a book on how to
ruin a good thing, livin without you
Thought I'll pay for my wrongs, guess I ain't have enough
Told me "Nigga I'm leavin," I had to call your bluff
Now I'm callin your phone, but you ain't pickin up
I should've gave you love, I should've gave you trust
And now you moved on, and you forgettin us
I'm singin this sad song, but you don't give a fuck


[Hook:]
And I hope you're happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)

There's nothin that hurts more than heartbreak
No one wants to take that fall
You're thinkin about her all day
Nothin else matters at all
And the only thing worse than her leavin
Is knowin it's your fault
And now I'm goin through withdrawals


[Hook:]
I hope you're happy (I hope you're happy)
Hope you got what you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
Diamond rings and old barstools
One's for queens and one's for fools
One's the future and one's the past
One's forever and one won't last


[Chorus:]
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The "I love you's," the "I told you so's"
Past few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone


[Repeat Chorus]

We ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools
Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
Horatio the human cannonball
A weddin' 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddlin' she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find
That ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
Well, me an' my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon light
A corner bar, an it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end an' looking half asleep
An he walked up, an' said: "What'll it be?"
I said: "The good stuff"

He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kinda went misty
He said: "You can't find that here

'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin' so much
An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He grabbed a carton of milk an' he poured a glass
An' I smiled an' said: "I'll have some of that"
We sat there an' talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

I saw a black an' white picture an' it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: "That's my Bonnie
Taken 'bout a year after we were wed"

He said "Spent five years in the bar
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love"
"An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Bein' right there as our time got small
An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He said: "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
An' look into those eyes, so deep in love
An' drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"
I can see you over there
Staring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink
All alone tonight

And chances are
You're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while
Baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But, darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

I'm not tryna
Be another just
Pick you up
Kinda guy
Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home
But I just don't understand
How another man
Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold

Well, I've had enough to drink
And it's makin'
Me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright
Baby

'Cause blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But, darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color, no,no no
Mmm. It ain't your color, baby

Mmm, baby.

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But, darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color
Blue ain't your color

Mmm. No, no, baby
Come here, baby
Lemme light up your world
Got a hole in my boots
I gotta watch where I spit
Every time I chew
Got a hole in my boots

Got a hole in my jeans
Been working so hard
They're about to fall apart
At the seams
I got a hole in my jeans

It's Friday night
When I'm out on the town
Man you know you're gonna
Find me somewhere

There's a hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm climbing in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

There's a hole in the wall
Where the neon lights
Shine bright as a disco ball
That's my hole in the wall

Well I got a hole in my heart
I can slide right up to some
Pretty little thing at the bar
Patch that hole in my heart

You can pop a top
You can twist that lid
Doesn't really matter
Just as long as you give me

That hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm climbing in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

I don't care if it's from Tennessee
Kentucky or Denver, Colorado
Make it from wheat, make it from corn
I don't really care
Buddy just make it pour

From that hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm climbing in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?

And while I've got your attention

The preacher said he died too young
Over there totin' that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started prayin'
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazin'

And that's one hell of an amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
Yeah this is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an amen, amen

Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
Well if you think I'm scared
You got me all wrong
No, a little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
And started prayin'
No he never gave up
Said the good Lord's waitin'

And that's one hell of an amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
Yeah this is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an amen

So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an amen
Amen
That's a hell of an amen
You're crashing into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Trying to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

Wrecking ball dancing down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

Only thing I want to do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in
And your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria, your lips taste like sangria

Oh

Only thing I want to do tonight is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
I been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man's had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie.

Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I'd pray it's not too late

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be

Sweet Annie.

Turn out the lights
These hands, they long to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

Oh...

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin' in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me

Sweet Annie.
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


[Chorus:]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I canât even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


[Chorus]


[Thomas Rhett:]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight


[Thomas Rhett (Maren Morris):]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you


[Thomas Rhett:]
All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do


[Thomas Rhett (Maren Morris):]
I never had something that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's something 'bout you I just can't fight


[Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris:]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you


[Thomas Rhett (Maren Morris):]
(I'm always craving you)
Craving you
Craving you


[Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris:]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go


[Thomas Rhett (Maren Morris):]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you, yeah
Craving you


[Thomas Rhett (Maren Morris):]
Craving you
(I'm craving you baby)
I'm craving you
I'm craving you babe
Real men love fishin'
Fast cars and livin'
Out on the edge so far
They're gonna need forgivin'
Real men like football
Cowboys and outlaws
Can't help but fly so high
It's gonna hurt to fall

They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don't need a reason

Real men love Jesus
And they love mama
If they can get more than forty hours
You know they gonna
They give it hell till they get it right
The kind every country girl's tryin' to find
Every girl's daddy's kinda guy
Ain't scared to pray, ain't scared to fight

They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don't need a reason
Real men love Jesus

Real men love Jesus
They don't believe in leavin'
When the goin' gets tough
They just keep on keepin'

They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin'
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don't need a reason
Real men love Jesus
Real men love Jesus
Mmm
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
Whole party dressed up
But you just doin' your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you

When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothin'

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah

Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothin' like you
Rockin' that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you, yeah

Never seen, never seen nothin' like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Mmm
Never seen nothin' like you
I sure could use an âAtta boyâ or a big ol' high five
I'd love to hear âYou're killin' it dudeâ, it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change âcause

Every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it

Let's say your baby's mad âcause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed from late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head and looks at you and says âAin't you good for anything?â
And you say

Every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
If you want a margarita
I'll get tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it
With a cold one in my other hand
And I'll be crushin' it

When I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot
Punch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead
Yeah, I got this
I'll be crushin' it
Oh, I'll be crushin' it

I figured this out in college walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best or brightest guy around
But like the great George freaking Strait, I'm the king of gettin' unwound

And every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
Every week has a weekend
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it
By this time Friday night
Oh, I'll be crushin' it
I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it
Of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
I'll be crushin' it
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
The life she wanted â it was gone
Prince Charming â I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Now she sees right through me

Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
So did I
So don't smile at me it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)
Should I hold on
We will never make it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)

Should I hold on
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over
I don't care that you done me wrong
'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is

I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us.

But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen.
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey.

It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart

'Cause I'm drinking to a country song.
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen.
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey.

Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas.
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
No, don't think for one second I'm out to drown your memory
Girl, you ain't worth the whiskey, no.
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey.
It's no secret that lately there ain't no escaping
That I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm headed on out the door

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened,
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing 'em down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what if's and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing 'em down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, don't say "No" so quick.
This ain't about me tryin' to see
How far that I can get,
But I ain't gonna lie,
I wouldn't mind
Just a little bit of you and I:
Eye to eye,
Lips on lips, swayin' to the music
Real close.
We could both use
A little let-go
Kinda night,
Baby, if you want a good time.

We can get on it.
Let's take a shot or you can sip on it.
We'll find a floor we can dance on it, slow-song it.
'Far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it.
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights.

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it.
Sounds pretty good, don't it?

Well, I've just now seen that smile
And I bet it's been a minute since you tapped on
Into your wild and crazy side.
So, baby, let's do this tonight.
Baby, that moon looks just right.
Don't fight it.
If you want a good time

We can get on it.
Take a shot or you can sip on it.
We'll find a floor we can dance on it, slow-song it.
'Far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it.
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights.

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it.
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?

So, baby, let's get on it.
You're gonna love it, you can bet on it.
Karaoke: we can microphone it.
Whatever you want it.

As far as I can see that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby, bring on it.
It's one of those stars-falling,
Love-calling,
Get-your-feeling-all-right nights

Sounds good, don't it? Don't it?
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?

Yeah, don't it?
Get your feeling all right, girl.
Yeah, it sounds pretty good now, don't it?
Now, don't it, baby?
Maybe one day I'll just let it all go
Let every shade of my true colors show
Keep loving me and I'll lose all control
Eventually...

Never wanna be, never wanna be that girl
With a million needs, who keeps running your world
Boy, do you lie, when you say I look good tonight.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
But you hear a song, you hear a song

They keep talking,
All the ghosts from my past
Heart broken,
Can't get over it fast
Just give it up, stays around,
And it never leaves.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
But you hear a song, you hear a song

A one note symphony... Baby come on
And sing it back to me.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
It sounds like the chaos I hear in my head all night long
You hear a song, you hear a song, you hear a song
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, but I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year
Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl

The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go
Woah-oh, yeah

I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl

(Guy with the girl)
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin' for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin', we were buzzin'
Takin' shots like it was nothin'
Did the runnin' man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn't think that it was true

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin'
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
My friends call me up 'cause they know I'm down
Take me out to paint the town and help me get over it
Pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar
Buys a drink, gives a wink, and then it goes too far
We're out on the dance floor feelin' the gin
I finally start coming alive again
I take her home for the night
And everything is right until the first ray of sunlight
And damn if I don't wake up lovin' you

Oh I wake up lovin' you

Thought if I could catch a plane, touch down, out of town
Somewhere nobody knows you
Maybe I could give myself half of a chance
To get a life and act a like a different man
But my best of intentions were all shot to hell
And I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel
Drownin' in the whiskey, starin' at the T.V., tryin' not to sleep
'Cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you

Yeah I wake up lovin' you, yeah

Yeah I wake up lovin' you,
Yeah I wake up lovin' you

Remember when I told you I was never going to stop
Lovin' you with all my heart and soul no matter what
Now it seems I'm breaking every promise that I made
'Cause every night I'm desperate
Askin' God if He would just let me forget it
But I wake up lovin' you

I wake up lovin' you

I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, yeah
I wake up lovin' you, oh
I wake up lovin' you
I wake up lovin' you
I wake up lovin' you
The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll

Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah, holler at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat, oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll


[Luke Bryan:]
Yeah, we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream of that one day

'Cause this is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside, baby
This is how we roll

Yeah, this is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll
Yeah, this is how we roll
I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a haircut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up someone George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl, dancin' in the sunset
To get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
I did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on it all night kiss

I did it for the girl, dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt and pull me through the front door
I did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl
It was our first week
At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began

It was 102Â°
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in

We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here

'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
...you and me

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

First week
Myrtle Beach
Where it all began..
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past


[Chorus:]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people call it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge


[Chorus:]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away (blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away (blown away)
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday (blown away)
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,

Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Well hey, this is you and me against the world
Two crazy kids, a boy and a girl
You're a spark, a match, I'm gasoline
You light me up honey, what I mean is

You put the beat in my heart
You put the smile on my face
You put the color in my sky
Otherwise a cloudy day
You put the swing in my dance
You put the speed in my run
Close your eyes, baby
Kiss the midnight sun
I'm a fire because of you
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue

We're all gonna fall, that's part of the plan
Hold on to each other when we got no place to stand
When it feels like we're a million miles apart
I'll be shouting for you in the dark cause

You put the beat in my heart
You put the smile on my face
You put the color in my sky
Otherwise a cloudy day
You put the swing in my dance
You put the speed in my run
Close your eyes, baby
Kiss the midnight sun
I'm a fire because of you
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue

[x2]

Yeah, I'm a fire because of you
Yeah, I'm a fire, burning blue
Yeah, I'm a fire
Yeah, I'm a fire
Baby, I'm a fire
Oh, I'm a fire, burning blue
Hey, girl, I'm just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is...


[Chorus:]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

When I'm with you I can see down the road, girl
Not just the gravel when we're travelin' on, girl
And I'm bettin' that it's gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I'm gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin'
So, baby, let's take it, take it...


[Chorus]

I ain't gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I'm a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
So let me love you...


[Chorus]

Baby, I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

Yeah
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby âtil then

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

I'll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking âbout doing
Since the moment, girl, we met

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

Yeah, think a little less
Yeah, think a little less
There's a trail of smoke comin' out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt from a few too many beers

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw 'em up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been and we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world

In that old sea shell you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash whisper in your ear
A little glow in the night, its the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing called 'make me disappear'

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw 'em up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been, we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world

There ain't no empty glasses, they're playing drift away
That's where the magic happens, back up in that little bay

We'll set sail
Yeah I see you there wind in your hair
And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales
It's like nowhere else
You've ever been, we'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall it'll still be there
Next time we come back girl, to the bar at the end of the world
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Backed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern bells
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Your side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love the way you, love the way you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
Sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Girl, just look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playin' throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move
Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?
I swear I felt it slowing down for a minute
I know it sounds crazy, but looking at you, baby
With your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion
Your body's swaying like a waves in the ocean
I know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking

If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time

Ain't gotta worry about a beach bar closing
I got a bottle of tequila we can open right here
I'm just saying, it's like we're on vacation

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time, yeah

If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need Cabo tan on your skin
My hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time
She got a smile that makes your worst day feel like it's your birthday
She's got a laugh like confetti would change her name if she'd let me
She's got a way of changing the game the way that you play is never the same

(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Ride around, windows down, yell with the radio
(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Drop your plans, drop a grand, hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her, she make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall, make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her

The way that she moves is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster, heart is pumping faster
She's head to toe, body and soul, so beautiful, she don't even know

(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Ride around, windows down, yell with the radio
(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Drop your plans, drop a grand, hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her, she make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall, make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah...
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah...

For her I would walk a straight line
Wear out the soles of my shoes for her
I would run through the night just to kiss her one more time, if she wanted me to

(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Ride around, windows down, yell with the radio
(She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Drop your plans, drop a grand, hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her, she make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall, make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah...
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah...
I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?

Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you

Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along
And he don't even know a single word

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in
We'll just sail away

But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

Well Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer
Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's about to graduate
From college

I'm just flicking ash
Into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah we're just blowin' smoke

We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake, yeah
We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here going broke
Hey yeah
Yeah we're just blowin' smoke
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows Iâd sip it nice and slow
Iâd try to pick a place that ainât too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go

You can bet Iâd order up a couple tall ones
Tell the waitress put âem on my tab
Iâd be sure to let him do the talkinâ
Careful when I got the chance to ask

Howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Do you hear the prayers I send
What happens when life ends
And when you think youâre cominâ back again
Iâd tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

If I could have a beer with Jesus
Iâd put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
Fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
Sit somewhere we couldnât see a clock

Ask him howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Have you been there from the start
Howâd you change a sinnerâs heart
And is heaven really just beyond the stars
Iâd tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

He can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray heâs stayinâ till we shut the whole place down

Ask him howâd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me
Whatâs on the other side?
Is mom and daddy alright?
And if it ainât no trouble tell them I said hi
Iâd tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Iâd tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
I see main street closing
Miles of âFor Saleâ signs
And them fields ainât growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release,
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until itâs all alright
Yeah

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

I donât wanna lose this feeling
And I donât wanna close my eyes
I donât wanna remember what Iâm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
Tip it on back

Yeah, I donât wanna lose this feeling
I donât wanna close my eyes
I donât wanna remember what Iâm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back

Feel the sweet release of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back
I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson Sunday morning
I'm a mom and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

I spent a lot of years running from believing, looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it: there's only one way home

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
That's right
Now and then I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though its been so long it brings me back
Right back to you

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me

How yah been I'd love to hear bout how you been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had and love to have again

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow we'll do it all over again

I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, nah they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
If you're one of us, raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back, come push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

I'm a member of a good timing crowd
We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
If you're one of us, raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music, a little whiskey, a little beer
We're gonna shake off those long week blues
Ladies, break out your dancing shoes
It don't matter what night it is, it's Friday
It's Saturday and Sunday
I just want to hear you say
I just want to hear you sing it
Y'all sing it with me

We belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
If you're one of us, raise your glass
We belong to the drinking class

Yeah, we belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
And if you're one of us, raise your glass
We belong to the drinking class
Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half of your butterfly tattoo.

Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park.

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
I'd hate to waste a night like this

I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you when we get there is me.

You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want.

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

You never know where one might be
There's lots of places that are hard to reach
I gotcha.

I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

I'd sure like to check you for ticks...
Brady was a baseball star
Til he struck out and took his car and drove away
Sissy lost her little boy
Hitch-hiked up to Illinois, so they say

Then it rained so hard that Mary tried
To take her life with suicide
And disappear just like the thunder
You ask around and no-one knows
Where they went or what they do
But you wonder, I know you wonder

Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
Theyâre in need of a mindbender
Iâm a bartender
At the end of the day
Iâm all theyâve got
Hope on the rocks

Charlieâs wife filed for divorce
And Charlie bought a quarter horse and now he's ridin' fences,
Upside down and couldnât pay
They hauled Sue's mobile home away
And we ainât seen her since
Larryâs long time fiancÃ©
Got kicked out of the P.T.A.
And moved her kids back east with someone else
All and the ones you used to know
Donât drop in or say hello
But you ask yourself
I know you ask yourself

Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
Theyâre in need of a mindbender
Iâm a bartender
At the end of the day
Iâm all theyâve got
Hope on the rocks

Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
Theyâre in need of a mindbender
Iâm a bartender
At the end of the day
Iâm all theyâve got
Hope on the rocks
Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

I've been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would've noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

I hear love songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
I'm a good slow dancer but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah they do

Everybody got somebody got somebody

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

Sitting here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even Cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me

Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you

But everybody's got somebody but me

Everybody got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now

(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody has got somebody
(Everybody but me)
Everybody but me

(Everybody's got somebody)
Everybody
I miss you
(Everybody but me)
Everybody's got somebody but me
Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
It took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you

I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore

Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause baby you don't sound like you anymore
Oh, anymore

That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you wanna come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannon ball splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you
Gimme the girl I knew
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore
Mmm, anymore

Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
One day, I'll slow and lay down,
Spend my weekends in a swing out on the wraparound.
Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system.
Yeah I might stay out all night,
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right.

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now I might have to kiss no telling how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is.
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches,
Don't learn nothing 'til you make a lot of mistakes.
How will I know where to draw the line
If I don't cross it a few hundred times?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah I'm gonna stay out all night,
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right
I've gotta live a lot of life if I'm gonna give good advice
When I'm talking to my grand-babies
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Young and crazy.
Young, young and crazy.
Young and crazy.
I saw your picture in a paper, Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ball cap in a pick up, seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man

Yeah there's the old you that I knew,
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Back woods on a four wheel, hanging on tight, I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy and she got the man

I got the first kiss and sheâll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man
Girl you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Ya, it's what we came here to forget

Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget

What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget
I been hangin' round this place, I been lookin' through your space
I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're goin' far

Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,
Were you even here at all?

Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't givin' you away

Now it's been two days
I'm still lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand

Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
I've been lookin' for you baby
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh even though you're gone, somehow you stay


[Chorus:]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in?
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh even though you left me you're still here


[Chorus]

I can't shake you
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you
I can't shake you
And I don't know why


[Chorus]

Well it's hotter than hell outside right now
It's 100 in the shade with the sun beating down
Forecast calling for some more of the same
Well I can't fix that but I can fix a drink

I turn on Fox news and then CNN
But it's the same dang thing all over again
The world's in the toilet and the market's in the tank
Well I can't fix that, no

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink

Say you gotta broken phone and a broken heart
The boss is on your back and your truck won't start
None of your friends want to listen to Hank
Well I can't fix that, no

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink

I don't know what's going on with you
But if you got some cheap whisky and some Mountain Dew
Malibu player vogue coke in a cup
Brother I can hook you up

But I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get'cha feeling right
I can get'cha buzzed, I can get'cha smiling
I can make you feel like you're sitting on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
Tell me what you think, yeah
I can fix a drink
Yeah, I can fix a drink
I know you don't mean to be mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately you make me feel all I am is a back-up plan
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget
Everything I said

I buy into those eyes
And into your lies

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out

And still no sound

Of footsteps on my stairs
Or your voice anywhere

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help
Got a hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
(Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair
(I know every curve like the back of my hand)
The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spills
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of "Night Moves"

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Ohh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Ohh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

When you're searching the horizon
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh, I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, Oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh.
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke

Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find

Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't wanna wake up
In this burning house

And I've been sleepwalking, been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke and make it right
I've been sleepwalking too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
May we all get to grow up in our red, white and blue little town
Get a won't-start-hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed-in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall
May we all

May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us
But we'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall
May we all

May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times

May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall
May we all
May we all
May we all

May we all
Get to have a chance to ride the fast one
May we all
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
May we all
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one
Yeah, the last one

Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall
May we all
Just like you know your southern stars always gonna come back out

Open up your heart, open up your eyes, baby listen to the sound
Of my voice when I tell you girl donât worry I ainât ever gonna let you down
I wanna show you where Iâm from, take you for a ride on a long dirt road
Let you see, let you taste, let you feel, just a little bit of that moonshine glow
I wonât hold you down, or hold you back, but I wonât let you go
This ainât no one night show

I heard you lookinâ for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you lookinâ for a good man

Got lots of bars around this town
They got cold beer, yeah, and they got Crown
Got neon light in the windowpane
Got lots of guys thinkin' they got game
Got loud guitars a little out of tune
But they ain't got a girl like you
Naw, they don't

They play lots of songs on the radio
'Bout them good ole' country girls that we all know
Long tan legs and cutoff jeans
Yeah, just shakin' that sugar every country boy's dream
I've heard them all at least a time or two
Ain't none 'bout a girl like you, that's true

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

You can dress it on up or you can just hang out
Kick it on Broadway or kick back on the couch
You can dance on a bar, you can dance in the rain
Shotgun a beer, just sip champagne
Yeah, there's only one, ain't room for two
There ain't another girl like you, another girl like you

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

Baby, what did I do to get a girl like you

A girl like you don't come along but once in a lifetime, better hang on
I can't find one thing wrong, I could just go on and on and on

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

I could sail the ocean blue, and never find, never find a girl like you
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives

They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know

All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
They don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way

They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
No, they don't know

They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around

They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
No, they don't know
Life was great,
Wouldn't change a thing,
I had it all but with you I had more,
But out of nowhere out of the blue,
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling.

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

I'm on the floor cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know I got to let you go
So the liquor helps me forget,
Your name, Your face
This pain I can't erase

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

Now you're gone, You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah

So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

Yeah, Iâm here to pick you up
And I hope I donât let you down, no, âcause

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

Youâre the one I want, youâre the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
Youâre the rock in my roll
Youâre good for my soul, itâs true
Iâm head over boots for you

I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Eighty-Nine Cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hanginâ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy, but thatâs alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and Iâve got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And youâd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollinâ down on my face
Hey, man Iâm tryinâ to be tough
And momma asked me this morning
If Iâd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ainât where I feel you anyway

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

Iâve cussed, Iâve prayed, Iâve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when Iâm missing you this much

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the painâs a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes, brother sometimes

I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you donât mind, I hope you donât mind
I drive your truck
There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you

There's something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
Worn and haggard, weathered and torn
Drug through the keyhole of that back door
Blood shot red behind these shades
I look like hell, yes, I've seen better days

And then those loving armsâthey pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

I'm rust on a barbed wire, I'm dust on a chrome yeah
Yes I'm the heart that bleeds in an old country song

And then those loving armsâthey pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

Leather and lace, denim and pearls,
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here loving me

Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work
And she slips her hands right under my shirt

Oh, with those loving arms she pulls me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

There you go, baby, making me look good again
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
âTold him just how our story ends
âDid all I could to try to make it work
âBut you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt
â
âI've been out the house, climbin' them walls
âCheckin' that calendar, exin' days off
âHit another bar, call another friend
âThrow a few down, tell the story again
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
âI can just lie and say it's all okay
âOh-ho, what can I do?
âBeen goin' through Hell gettin' over you
âBut it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
âNo it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
â
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
âLife is good, I met me a girl
âShe got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
âI don't hardly ever think about you
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

âSometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
âSometimes I break down and cry
â
âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you

âHey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
âNo it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

C'mon now
Aww that's right
Oh you look so fine

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt
Iâm so confused
I know I heard You loud and clear
So, I followed through
Somehow I ended up here
I donât wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All Iâve got is hurt and these four words

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know Youâre good
But this donât feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
Itâs hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that Youâre God
And I am not
So

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
So

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had "The Guns" on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, "Sweet Child O' Mine"
Sipping on the locos spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?

Out of nowhere it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that we knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the colour from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grid and the game

But I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
We had "The Guns" on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, "Sweet Child O' Mine"
Sipping on the locos spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses drying out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads, your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time?
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now?
Time, time, time
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

Now baby don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
Plain and simple, girl them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

Now baby don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna

You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine


[Chorus:]
Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think You'll see
Those Lonely Eyes
Don't have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way,
Heaven help me make 'em stay


[Chorus]

Don't make me pay my tab
Catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign
Just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside

Lonely eyes
Lonely eyes
Sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes
They don't have to be alone tonight
Lonely Eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight
You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away
But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never,
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

Somethin' 'bout that southern sky
Sittin' back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Somethin' 'bout the way you're smiling
Makin' them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell you baby
Tonight looks good on you

Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at the party
Good at the bar
Somethin' 'bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're lookin' so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby, yeah
They're boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another gray September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime

I brace myself against the cold
Let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime

Just a little more summertime

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime
You can find my face where the moon light lingers
Cause it's Friday night and it's as hot as ever
My heart is banging to the beat of the band
Me and my pals we got scars from the week
But now we're all getting loud and we're moving our feet
As we do our best to let things get out of hand

It's a night gone wasted again
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted
Oh yeah

All of our eyes they've got rings of fire
Cause we're burning time like there's no tomorrow
It's gonna take a while to blow off a week's worth of steam
Tell your sweet mama not to worry her pretty little head
I'll have you home soon and then I'll tuck you in bed
But until then let's do our best to get out of hand

Man oh man

It's a night gone wasted again
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends
Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted
Oh yeah

Oh what a riot it's been
I'm gonna save up some more money to spend on another night

Well well well
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go 'round
It's a night gone wasted tonight
Alright
We're going out tonight
Again

Oh yeah
I've, I've been gone, I've been gone too long
Singin' my songs on the road, another town
One more show then I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door and

I'm gonna find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheet rock
Knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby like a wrecking ball

You, look at you, send me one more shot
Sittin' on a bathroom sink
Damn, you really turn me on
Painting your toenails pink
Easy baby for you to say
But if I can make it just one more day

That whole house is gonna be shakin'
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised
If the whole damn place just falls
Wanna rock you baby like a wrecking ball

And that old house is gonna be shakin'
Rafter rockin', foundation quakin'
Crash right through the front door
Back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby like a wrecking ball
You hear a new song, and it's your favorite
And pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
Heavy into everything
Ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while then you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shines gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

Whoa whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep a slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Whoa whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

Whoa whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number, listening to my favorite bands
I'll say, hey baby, you know all you can say is come and get me
I'm gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you miss me
Ain't no corn in that field
Big crack in the windshield
From that January cold snap
Baby don't look back
I got the wheel, yeah

Three hundred twenty nine
Miles to the shoreline
Sunset on a billboard
Girl that's what we're in for
Yeah, that's a good sign

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather
Yeah

No, it won't be long now
We'll be rollin' these windows down
You'll be pullin' that sweater off
Puttin' on a summer song and
Crankin' it up loud, yeah

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather

Gotta get you outta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun
Wanna see you lyin' there
Your bikini top girl and I'm done
Can't wait to get there

No, I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in the blue sky
Gettin' you outta here
Put your shades on, lay it back, enjoy the ride
You and me together
We're on our way to better
You and me together
We're on our way to better
A wayfarer weather, wayfarer weather

(Gotta get you outta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun)
Oh wayfarer weather
Underneath that big blue sky, yeah
(Wanna see you lyin' there
Your bikini top girl and I'm done)
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too

Better watch out for the boys in blue
And, all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread?
Like I know somethin' y'all don't know,
Man that talk is gettin' old
You better mind your business man,
Watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them ol' dirt roads, is what y'all missin'

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really want to know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the black top ends

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights

It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

[Verse 1:]
I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial


[Chorus:]
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church


[Verse 2:]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away


[Chorus:]
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church


[Chorus:]
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church


[Chorus:]
Hey, Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church
All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans on cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist of your favorite songs
And when I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind the high beams
Oooh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So gimme that aww yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss, wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a crook
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime, blowin' your mind
Burnin' down these back roads

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind the high beams
Oooh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, livin' careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So gimme that aww yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, gimme that "let's go", and I'll give you that good good time

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind a high beams
Oooh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, livin' careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Mmm girl, if you're down to ride one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some guts and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lite
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

One, two, three..

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends
(Alright)

Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends
All we do right is make love and
We both know now that ainât enough
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didnât work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Kiss tomorrow goodbye.
She rolled in my little sandy town
She spent the summer there a couple houses down
Well, there was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

Well, she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away

Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I can see her face
Wishing I could hold her

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away

Yeah, she was the one that got away
Yeah, she wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away

She rolled in my little sandy town
She spent the summer there a couple houses down
Blame the whiskey on the beer
Blame the beer on the whiskey
Blame the mornin' on the night
For whose lyin' here with me
Blame the bar for the band
Blame the band for the song
Blame the song for the party that went all night long

But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault

Blame the heart for the hurtin'
Blame the hurtin' on the heart
Blame the dark on the devil
Blame the devil on the dark
Blame the ex for the drinkin'
Blame the drinkin' for the ex
Blame the two for one tequila's for whatever happens next

But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain't my fault

Blame my raisin' on my name
Blame my name on my raisin'
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn't take a joke
But it ain't my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time

No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parkin' lot
It was 2 for 1 and 4 for 2
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up, like I was on you

I say "Hey, hey, baby do you wanna come over"
You say "No way", then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my

T-Shirt, right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt (Yeah)
(You look good in my t-shirt, girl)
(Oh yeah)

We were walkin' up the stairs with the neighbors sayin', keep it down
But, it's hard to unlock the door when you're makin' out (know what I'm sayin')
You've been sayin' that we've gotta quit doing this,
So, why you leanin' in for one more kiss,
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

T-Shirt, right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt (in my t-shirt)

(Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look g-ood on my mind)

I say "Hey, hey, baby do you wanna come over"
You say "No way", then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were in my T-Shirt
(Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt)

I see you spinnin' around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot

In my T-Shirt right there
Your hair, messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh, oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head, you were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like -your dress -my floor -the way -you wore -my, my T-Shirt

(Nah nah nah nah nah-nah-nah)
(You look good in my t-shirt, baby)
(Yeah, you look so good in my t-shirt)
(Yeah baby, you look good in my t-shirt)
(Oh yes, you look so good in my t-shirt)
(Nah nah nah nah nah-nah-nah)
He said, "I've been where you've been before.
Down every hallway's a slamming door.
No way out, no one to come and save me.
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me.

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you,
Opened my eyes and told me the truth."
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better."
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water (amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (how sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (that saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (like me)
Oh, yeah

I am changed (I once was lost)
Stronger (but now I'm found)
(was blind but now I see)
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soirÃ©e
If you're in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe

Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm a bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof (roof's on fire)
We'll go to town like they're in your living room

Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm a bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I woulda just layed my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

You hit me category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'
But he ain't got nothing on you

I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, ah


[Chorus:]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder roll in
It makes you move a little closer to me
And girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep

We can worry bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do


[Chorus:]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on
Baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere
I'm all yours tonight


[Chorus:]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna here you say come on over, cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do
Ohhh ohh ohh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Ohhh
Get your pretty little self shined up
Girl were gettin' outta here, yeah we're getting' out there tonight
We can take it through town 'til the roads run out
Where the world slows down, watch the moon get drunk on you
Smile

Can't get there quick enough
Can't wait to drink it up
Gonna find your favorite song
And watch it turn you on

So I can see your sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight

(No way I'm gonna get you home)
(No way I'm gonna get you home)

Ruby red deep Eddy in your cup
Just a sip of that stuff makes your lips so sweet when ya kiss me
Kiss me baby
Get your bare feet in the cool grass
Get to movin' that oh yeah oh yeah ya know just how to kill me
Killin' me baby
The sun is burnin' out
Let's pull it over now
Can't wait to watch ya let your hair down, hair down

So I can see that sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights, hmm
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight

I can see your sweet little summer time silhouette swayin'
Shakin' in the shadows of the headlights
I'm sittin' here sweatin' I'm losin' my breath
And I'm catchin' that green light look in your blue eyes
You got me all messed up, you're lookin' so damn fine
Girl there ain't no way, I'm gonna get you home
Before midnight
Before midnight

Get you home before midnight
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
Before midnight
(No way I'm gonna get you home)
Before midnight
You are overbearing; I'm not in love
But I don't wanna tell you
We've been contemplating how to give it up
But I can't convince you
We've been hopelessly holding too tight
When we don't even need to
And as the water fills this sinking ship
I know we have to leave too

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm lying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah

Said I'm moving on, cause things were getting rough
But here I am in your bed
I strung it on too long, afraid to be alone
Now we're in over our heads
It's either sink or swim, we've tried so many times
For worse or for better
It tears my heart in two to leave it all behind
And say goodbye forever

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm lying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah

Oh, you gotta let me leave
Oh, the weight will make us sink
Oh, could you please help me leave?
Oh, abandon ship with me

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm lying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday

Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)

[Brad:]
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again


[Brad:]
Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck

[Carrie:]
Remind me, remind me

[Brad:]
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough

[Carrie:]
Remind me, remind me


[Carrie:]
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop

[Brad:]
I felt bad cause you missed your flight

[Carrie and Brad:]
But that meant we had one more night


[Carrie:]
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep

[Brad:]
Remind me, baby, remind me

[Carrie:]
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much

[Brad:]
Remind me, baby, remind me


[Brad:]
I wanna feel that way

[Carrie:]
Yeah, I wanna hold you close

[Brad and Carrie]
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know


[Carrie:]
Baby, remind me, remind me


[Carrie:]
Do you remember the way it felt?

[Brad:]
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves

[Carrie:]
Remind me

[Brad:]
Yeah, remind me

[Carrie:]
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me


[Brad:]
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me


[Brad and Carrie]
Oh, baby, remind me


[Carrie:]
Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me

[Brad:]
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt

[Carrie:]
Remind me, yeah, oh

[Brad:]
Baby, remind me
Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
I tell 'em Super Cuts, let's leave it long in the back
Wearing the tux at a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing "Already Gone" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything

Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

Biscuits and gravy at momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing "Purple Rain"
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)
Walk with me in a moonlight babe
Lose ourselves in a star parade
And i will sing a midnight serenade for you
Dance with me in a field of green
Be so close i can hear you breathe
Be the end and the in between


[Chorus]
Cause to know you is to know love
And to know love is to know enough
To walk with you through this life
From now until the day i die
What better way is there to live
Than to live with you

So put your song in my silver sky
Put your rain in my river dry
Put your words to my lullaby
And I'll dream of you


[Chorus]


[Chorus]

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rode away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rode away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

She don't love you
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
I remember her in the sunlight
I remember her when she was mine
Mine
Roll in the bar, me and my crewâ¨
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookinâ me up, yeahâ¨
Buyinâ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing


[Chorus:]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anythingâ¨
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreamsâ¨
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see youâ¨
Jumpinâ up there with the bandâ¨
Takinâ me by the handâ¨
Hey boy, come dance with meâ¨
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truckâ¨
By the light of the midnight moonâ¨
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it goodâ¨
You don't know how bad that I wish I couldâ¨
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong


[Repeat Chorus]

Your lips, your eyesâ¨
Girl, since you told me goodbye


[Repeat Chorus]

Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you

[Verse 1]
Yeah I see you over there makin' eyes at me
Like you don't wanna get caught
Where'd you get the cowboy on your arm
And where you want me to drop him off
I see you tryin' to hide that fire inside
But your hold me back's almost gone
Yeah it's about time I let cowboy know
That I'm a gonna take you home


[Chorus 1]
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way


[Verse 2]
Yeah I can tell by the way I took your hand
And then asked you to dance
He went all John Wayne in front of his friends
And said I don't think so man
Yeah all blowed up like a loud mouth pup
Never been in a junkyard fight
But if you're gonna bark at the big dog boy
Then you're gonna get to feel the bite


[Chorus 2]
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can finish sweepin' her off her pretty little feet
And your buddies can carry you home
You can back off and let her dance with me
And live to fight another day
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way


[Verse 3]
Yeah I love the way the sun's comin' through
And bouncin' off the small of your back
Yeah I know if I call in sick today
Boss man will have a heart attack
Yeah I knew it was over when she rolled over
And said baby why don't you stay
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that,
Lookin' at me that, lookin' at me that way
The moon, outside, too bright
Those blinds, yeah, lets just keep them closed
You know, my hands they know where to go, to find your fingertips
Trace them back to your lips, take you on a trip
Flip that switch

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

Like your dress on the floor
Yeah, the one you don't need anymore,
Black like a sky, with no stars, just find me and fall into my arms

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black

I don't wanna see a thing
Baby, I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your love

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black

Make my world go black
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush

Black, black...
Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling falling and the window stuck
But the only thing that I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in


[Chorus:]
Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find somethin' on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good a little outta tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she' d look at me, I'll never forget that melody


[Chorus]

Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey, man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on


[Chorus]

All we needed, all we needed now
Was a, was a, was a radio
Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time we're together
Yeah, that's my dilemma
I need more time with ya
I wanna watch the sun rise through the pines with ya

Night like this, wouldn't wanna miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You can be the one I can get lucky with
If the boot fits

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Whoa
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Yeah baby we can run away
My carriage is a 4x4 400 horse Chevrolet
You're like a princess,
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Woah
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart, hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Woah
Let me show you how a country boy treats a lady
Woah
Go ahead kick em off cuz the boot fits baby

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Woah
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high
Cross my heart, hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Whoa
Mmm if the boot fits
Whoa
Yeah if the boot fits
I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
[x2]

You're like second nature baby, you're just like breathin'
A melody that you hear and you can't forget
The time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you were at the heartbreak of no regret

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
[x2]

I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
But I know that I ought to be the one who's strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
[x2]

I don't know where this is going but I know what I've been thinking
Since the sun started sinking down
I wanna take you where the vines grow up in the trees
We can roll up our jeans and figure this out

Oh oh oh,
Bring your bare feet
Oh oh oh,
Come with me

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

The stars are hanging low enough
For us to touch and show enough
We're gonna get closer tonight
We've been feeling what we're feeling without saying what we're meaning
No more beating round the bushes, alright?
Alright

Oh oh oh,
Are you ready?
Oh oh oh,
Come with me

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter

Down by the river, we're testing the water
Tryin' to cool off but it's just getting hotter
Let's take a little walk out on a limb
Close our eyes and jump in
If we're gonna fall, let's cannonball
Make a few waves and swim out a little bit
Farther in the holler
You and me baby, testing the water

Just testing the water
I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back

I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
(I love this life, I love this life, I love this life)

I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and I thank the Lord for this life of mine


[Chorus:]
I love my small-town world,
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love,
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life

Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Wrecking balls, downtown construction
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing
Cardboard sign says "The Lord is Coming"
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothing left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop this noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryin' to be heard in all this noise

All this noise
Can't take the noise
Can't take the noise
Can't stand the noise
Can't take the noise
I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warnin' from the blue lights
It's only going on 9 o'clock but
Feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight

Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
Ain't even make it halfway to town
And you're already talkin' 'bout a six pack
Already got your shoes off
And you're talkin' 'bout slippin' off
Nah we ain't even found your friends
And you already wanna get lost

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight

Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We just gettin' warmed up

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight
And we just gettin' started tonight
Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend Iâm a shelter for heartaches that donât have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that Iâll say is


[Chorus:]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Iâm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That Iâve never been here before
But you know and I know
That Iâll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But Iâll cry to my grave


[Chorus x2]

You only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
And my Dodge Dart classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?


[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Oh, heaven help me
I've been sowing wildflower seeds
And chasing tumble weeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just trying to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you baby
So guess what?


[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Oh, you only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar, and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama, y'all
And I love my apron
But I ain't your mama!
So guess what?


[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh
Oooohh, yeah. Ahhhhh. Oooooohh. Ah!
Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
Is too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, yeah man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast
On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say, "Let there be light!"
So He could tell the day time from the night
And then he spoke again,
Felt the wind come rolling in
Smelled the rain
It soaked everything

And then the mountains rose up,
Across the Great Plains
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing,
"All it's missing is a pretty thing"

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, come on.

He made me back in '68,
The first time I met her I was nearly eight
And she was ten.
Her name was little KayLynn.
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father,
I was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter.
Thought I was in, he made me think again.

But when I turned 16, I thought it couldn't get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt.

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, ooh, come on.

Ooh, let there be cowgirls
Ooh, let there be cowgirls

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man, Lordy
Something you can't tame,
She's a mustang
The heartbeat of the heartland
She's got a drawl, ya'll,
Yeah, she's the salt of the earth that rocks my world.
Let there be cowgirls, ooh
Let there be cowgirls, come on.
Rush hour traffic,
Always puts me in a bad mood.
I got chewed out by the boss today,
And now I'm stuck on highway 92.

Then you call me on my cell phone,
While I'm cussin' out a Cadillac.
You say remember Tom and Jenny's little boy?
Well, the doctors say the cancer's back.

Man its been one of those days,
When I been thinking poor me.
I got no right to complain I guess,
Cause right now all I can see.

Is a little angel in a Yankees cap,
It makes me realize.
It's just been one those days for me,
But for him it's been one of those lives.

Everybody under my roof,
Is healthy- knock on wood.
Oh but I sure do sweat the small stuff,
I don't thank God as much as I should.

Tonight I'm thinking about Tommy and Jenny,
And how they spent the last four years.
All those extended stays in Memphis,
All the sleepless nights, the prayers, the tears.

It's just been one of those days,
Where I was thinking poor me.
I got no right to complain I guess,
Cause right now all I can see.

Is that family moving back to Target House,
It makes me realize.
It's just been one those days for me,
But for them its been one of those lives.

And so it's been one of those days,
I let things get to me.
I got no right to complain,
Cause when I look around I see.

Folks that are fightin' for every breath,
And it makes me realize.
It's just been one for those days for me,
But for them it's been one of those lives.
Don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lyin'

If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buyin'


[Chorus:]
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you

Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?

Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me

I don't mind a little smoke gettin' in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me


[Chorus]

Well don't worry about the damage done,
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if you're lyin'


[Chorus]

Say you do
Just say you do
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

Damn you're looker
You're the cane and the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh till I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all money on you all over this town

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at
You thought it was over

Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll & Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at
Hahaha...
Cut!
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

Girl I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking about
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Boy, you gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you gonna hate this town
I wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is twenty counties wide
But boy, you gonna love seventeen
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

You gonna drive and kiss and throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You gonna drop the ball, hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will
'Cause you're a part of me
And a part of you
Will always be a...

Boy, you gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

You gonna drive and kiss and throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You gonna drop the ball, hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will
'Cause you're a part of me
And a part of you
Will always be my boy

It's 3 AM and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

But boy, you gonna come back home
You gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Until you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two
I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then

I got off track, I made mistakes
Back slid my way into that place where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won't go away
I hit my knees, now here I stand
There I was, now here I am
Here I am
Changed

I got a lot of "Hey, I'm sorry"s
The things I've done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em' that
Tell 'em that

I got off track, I made mistakes
Back slid my way into that place where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won't go away
I hit my knees, now here I stand
There I was, now here I am
Here I am

I'm changed for the better
More smiles, less bitter
I'm even starting to forgive myself

I hit my knees, I'm here I stand
There I was, now here I am
Here I am, here I am, here I am
I'm changed
Yes I am
I'm changed for the better
Thank God I'm changed
Kick the dust up
Come on

All week long it's a farming town
They're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Bar downtown, they got a line
Of people waiting out the door
Ten dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did
Kick it

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up

[Tim McGraw:]
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?


[Tim McGraw & Faith Hill:]
There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives


[Faith Hill:]
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son; it'd be Ryan


[Tim McGraw & Faith Hill:]
There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky thawed to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losing hope
But somehow baby
You broke through and saved me

You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killing my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singing, babe, hallelujah
We'll be touching
We'll be touching heaven

You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

I don't need these stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You're the healing hands where it used to hurt
You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy
Love me, love me, love me, mmm

Oh, hey
Boy with your hat back
Mmm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way,
I'mma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of

I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby,
Do you got what it takes?

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

Oh, hey
I've had my share of losers, liars, and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well, take a step back

'Cause I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby,
Are you just crazy, or crazy over me?

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

If you're gonna love me, love me, love me

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me

If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

Love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it
If she was a drink, she'd be single barrel bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick, a chill and a burn all at the same time
She's Sunday drive meets high-speed chase
She ain't just a song, she's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated that's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus:]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

I know how to make her laugh or blush or mad at me
But that's OK, there ain't no one more beautiful angry
And she loves just as deep as she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows, can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus:]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain, she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

She's the thrill of a lifetime a guy like me spends his whole life looking for
That girl right there's the perfect storm

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

(She destroys me in that t-shirt)
Another Friday night
There's a line of cars leaving
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sitting on the hood of mine drinking
I'm just a parking lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on saving me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
Long truck bed, hop in it, fire engine red like her lipstick
Out here we can let it go, yeah
Just me and my good friends, jug of wine a little sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little July sky, so high moon shine by the riverside
Stealin' hearts and runnin' wild
Yeah, our own world, Tennessee boys and girls runnin' free
Out here it's good times for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you wanna do, what's it gonna be
We can get wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice of watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back stickin' to the seat
We can sneak off and beat the heat
I'll be buzzin' on you honey like a bumblebee

Yeah, it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
That sun shining down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold
I'm a fool falling saying crazy things but I'm hoping and praying that you'll know what I mean yeah,
I wish I had the lines but if you could read between then you know what you mean to me

But when I say heaven I'll be laying by your side and about forever I mean as long as you'll be mine
But when I say perfect I mean every little thing that you do oh and when I say beautiful,

All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A.
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said

All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said

All the sheriffs said kid you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devils playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said

All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said

All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said

don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me all the pretty girls said

All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me all the pretty girls said

All the pretty girls said
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart

Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breakin'
You'd never want a heart

Ohh, ohh, oh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far

You ain't missin' nothin'
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darlin', you don't want a heart

Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
Glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now

By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh
So I guess it's over baby
DÃ©jÃ  vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one
That's in the shoes that I am

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away

I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
If others don't sing sad songs

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

That's right
Another lover
Another lover crash and burn
Ooooh yeah

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

Mhhhmm...

Mhhhmm...
I ain't rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can't buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true,
But it still sounds pretty cool

'Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beerâ¦
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting on a hundred millâ¦
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reelâ¦

And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat.
Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I'll wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice
If a melody is like a memory
You're a long hot summer night symphony
Blaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo
Down FM 109 on my FM Radio

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
You know it's been a while

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style singing

Rebel rebel at the top of our lungs
Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
Everybody said you'd never make it too far
With some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar

You know my crazy dreams,
Were busting at the seams
Just like these old boots and jeans

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going, never going outta style
We're never going outta style

I'll pop my collar do my best James Dean
We'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene
Show me your million dollar Marilyn smile
And I'll show you a love love love

That's never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
The way we love is never going outta style

Never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
We're never going outta style
In my Chevy, parking at the levy,
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
Never going outta style
We're never going outta style
Yeah, we're never going outta style
Alright
Make you wanna dance don't it baby

I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on a cornhole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's goin, that keg gonna be floatin'

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I'll sit you up on the kitchen sink
And stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin we gone by this evenin

But all I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

Take em out to the sticks, boys c'mon

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lay some Jack in my Coke
Work on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong with
Gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
It sure is pourinâ down tonight
It hasnât stopped since nine
And itâs poundinâ on the roof
Where under it I used to sleep with you
So good but not this time
Weâve gone so far apart since goodbye
And I couldnât feel more alone tonight
And youâre the only thing thatâs on my mind


[Chorus:]
And the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you

Yeah I should be cleaninâ my closet
Fixinâ that drippinâ water faucet
Anything to keep my mind from runninâ back to you
Instead Iâm lookinâ up at the ceilinâ
With that same old missing you feelinâ
Wonderinâ if youâre thinkinâ the same thing too


[Chorus:]
And the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you

Yeah I know we had to end it baby
Weâre pretty good at drivinâ each other crazy
But I will always love you


[Chorus:]
And as the thunder cries
And lightninâ strikes
Thatâs when I would hold you tight
And say everythingâs gonna be alright
Everythingâs gonna be alright
Iâd make you laugh to see you smile
Iâd get real close and whisper goodnight
And Iâm layinâ down thinkinâ âbout
All the things we could do
âCause this rainy nightâs no fun
Without you
Just ainât no fun without you
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heart beating with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught

These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl

How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no

These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
All you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl

Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Mmhmm, just a girl, just a girl

[Verse 1: Karen]
On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly


[Chorus:]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


[Verse 2: Jimi]
On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now


[Chorus:]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

Aren't you even gonna make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?


[Chorus: x2]
How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

On your side of the bed
Are you still awake, on your side of the bed.
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Yeah it's, "Yessir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard of
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk
Tick tock, I'm on the clock
And I'm feeling like this job's
Just nine to fivin' my life away
It's like I'm back at school
And I'm in the last class
And I'm passin' time until the bell rang
Havin' visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgates all up in the moonlight
And by the way
It's payday

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods lookin' like Panama City
Bunch of jacked-up trucks and bikinis
Got a yeti full of good ideas
Like I Ain't worried about drivin'
I'mma stay right here

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend
We live it up for the weekend

Somebody said somethin' 'bout church on Sunday, Amen
Somebody said somethin' 'bout work on Monday
Don't say it again

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot full of regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
Live it up for the weekend

Live it up
Live it up for the weekend
C'mon
Live it up
Live it up for the weekend
Live it up
Live it up
It's the weekend

[Verse 1 - Cole Swindell:]
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do but say uh huh
Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what


[Chorus - Cole Swindell:]
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner


[Verse 2 - Dierks Bentley:]
Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side


[Chorus - Cole Swindell:]
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


[Bridge - Cole Swindle & Dierks Bentley:]
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do?
What would Dierks do?
Grab a guitar and go sing her a song
And go play one of my songs?
No, don't play one of yours, play one of mine, man!


[Chorus - Dierks Bentley & Cole Swindell:]
Yeah, sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner


[Outro - Cole Swindell & Dierks Bentley:]
She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner
Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But youâre the kinda girl thatâs got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ainât nothing
They ainât never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ainât nothing hotter


[Chorus:]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
Iâll take a sip of that smile
Iâll bet the boys at home canât leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
Youâre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youâre just so homegrown

Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying âSon itâs onâ
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song


[Repeat Chorus]

Ooh baby, baby, baby
Youâre driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Iâm a long way away from where Iâm from
But baby you feel like home


[Repeat Chorus]

Youâre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youâre just so homegrown
Theyâre the in crowd, weâre the other ones
Itâs a different kind of cloth that weâre cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ainât
Weâre the paint where there ainât supposed to be paint

Thatâs who we are
Thatâs how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders

Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
Weâre the junkyard dogs, weâre the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back

Thatâs who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
Thatâs how we roll

Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
Weâre the riders, weâre the ones burning rubber off our tires.
Yeah, weâre the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire 'em up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh


[Interlude]

Weâre the bad news
Weâre the young guns
Weâre the ones that they told you to run from
Yeah, the playerâs gonna play, and a haters gonna hate
And a regulators born to regulate
When it hits the fan, and it all goes down
And the gloves come off
Youâre gonna find out just

Who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
Thatâs how we roll

Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the outsiders

Weâre the riders, weâre the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, weâre the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire 'em up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Youâre gonna know who we are


[Interlude]

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh


[Interlude]

Thatâs who we are
Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting across the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow
Like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight.
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer, so baby tell me would it be alright if we just take a little rain check and stay right here.
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do, as a matter of fact baby why don't you grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine.
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights, and baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair and I can take if from there.
Yeah I can take it from there.

I'm gonna put an ol' record on, Conway Twitty.
Yeah girl I'd love to lay you down.
Kill the ringer on the telephone, ain't gonna stop lovin' you til the candle burns out.
Oh there it is, that little smile of yours.
Come on, baby, what you waitin' for.
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine, walk down the hall and turn down the lights, and baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair.
And I can take it from there.

Tomorrow's gonna be here way too soon.
Let's not waste another minute girl, I got plans for me and you.
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine, walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights.
Baby while you're at it you might as well let down your hair.
And I can take it from there.
Oh I can take it from there.
Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Let's go
... to mess around
Feels good, darling

Big stars breaking out through the indigo
Chevy wind coming in, in stereo
Tail lights disappearin' bout a mile or so
Down the county road
Phone blowing up "where you is?"
Baby sayin' "baby, let's do this"
Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
Bout to lift it off, I'm bout to twist it off

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Well baby you ain't nothin' but a masterpiece
Swaying and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big loud beat
Nothin' but heat, come on

Somebody's rockin' that bang box
Everybody's hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tick tock
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night

Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Let's go

Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Come on

Come on
Let's go

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smoking up a faded out 4x4
Girls heading off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night

Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Come on baby
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Rearview crosses
Railroad ties
Oh, Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God, I miss when you were mine


[Chorus:]
Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine


[Repeat Chorus]

In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss


[Repeat Chorus]

Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I can feel your heartbeat, baby
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper, letâs donât talk
Baby, leave my T-shirt in the hall

Like a needle finds a groove,
Baby, weâll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction,
Itâs time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ainât holdinâ nothinâ these two hands
Until theyâre holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I donât wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So lets close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

Strip it down, down, down
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't

Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm

There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

All of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything

In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago, mmm
In case you didn't know, know, know
In case you didn't know
He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boots of my old man

My old man
She said, "California," as a tear fell down her cheek
"Small town Missouri just ain't the life for me."
Waved goodbye to mom and dad, and all her friends
In that '97 Mustang, that we both lost it in

I can't recall the day I'd finally had enough
Chasing my father's dream and never of growing up
I turned in that uniform before I ever played a game
With a junior college scholarship in a white trash town upstate

You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again, yeah

I made the most of no degree here selling cars
On the Westside of St. Louis where most the rich folks are
From time to time I hear about some star you met
And just how close you've come but haven't made it yet

It gets me thinking 'bout the way it was and all we could've been
Wondering if you ever wish you could feel that way again, oh, and feel that way again

You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again

I cannot lie sometimes when I come back to town
I head out to the river and roll the windows down
Listen to that Mississippi running through the night
Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side

Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side
Again, feel that way again

I wanna feel that way, I wanna feel that way again
I wanna feel that way, I wanna feel that way again
People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, tryin' to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world
I can see why they're all talkin'
Lookin' back at my past
I've got a bad name, but a man can change
I'm livin' proof of that

Til my last day, til my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, til they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you

Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest,
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around,
And baby don't you ever forget

Til my last day, til my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, til they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Darlin' yes I will

Til my last day, til my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, til they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Til my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Oh babe, til my last day
